Subject revised real  time generation for saturday   
there are a few changes to saturday  s schedule  so please disregard my previous email 
group 
the plan has slightly changed for submitting supplemental bids for our generators for saturday      the plan is as follows 
only submit supplemental bids for the generators if a stage  emergency is called  this is due to the iso  s ability to ramp the units up and down every  minutes  we don  t want to give them the ability to do this if there is not a stage     or  emergency 
so  please try to sell the generators excess available output as an sc to sc trade  below is their preschedule  mw  s available  minimum price threshold  and unit id  s  also  attached is a sheet with all the contact names and phone   s  please save it and reference it when dealing with the generators
