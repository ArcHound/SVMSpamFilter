Subject fsp status report
good afternoon 
i wanted to give everyone a status report on fsp before i head  out on vacation  in a nutshell  it  s not quite there  we are now meeting performance targets but we had a few too many bugs to allow users to complete the parallel in  time  i will begin paying my dollar a day debt starting on saturday but i feel fairly confident that we should wrap things up next week  susan amador will be working in portland next week  in my absence  to ensure real  time can finish up their part 
thanks  david poston
here are the details for the remaining  days of the parallel 
da preferreds  finals are complete for

 remaining critical bug on exercises for supplement schedules  should be finished tomorrow
preliminary schedule  contingent on no new critical bugs found by real  time 
  wrap  up ha parallel first part of next week
  migrate code to production end of next week
  begin production parallel  as suggested by phil platter  we will continue using the existing toolset but we will write da preferred templates out of fsp at the same time  then we can execute some compare utilities we have developed to ensure the iso templates between caps  fsp match perfectly 
  we will run in this mode until the users feel good about fsp
