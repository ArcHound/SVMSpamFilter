he  bought  mw from aquilla at a fixed price of   and sold  mw vs the  expost settlement price 
i found a decent offer for he       reliant  so i didn  t hedge
expost settled just above   for both hours and jason will be in on monday to confirm these prices with me
 i spoke with coral about financial deals as well but travis didn  t seem to understand which side of the deal he was on as he lowered his fixed offer as a counter
