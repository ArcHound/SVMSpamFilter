i just wanted to let you know that it  s going to take a couple weeks  i think  until i receive access to the timekeeping system  apparently after requesting access  isc sends back a ticket number and an fyi  below  
as soon as i receive access i will go back for your group and enter their time  and from then on keep track of the groups time for each month 
thanks  jill
