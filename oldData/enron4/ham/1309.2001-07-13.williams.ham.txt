Subject fall green room soccer
hi guys 
just a quick reminder that i do need to get a   from all of you who want
to play on the green room  s fall   soccer team  the money     nd
division or   for lst division  is due to the league by july  rd so i
need you to send me a check asap  my address is  sw dakota drive
tualatin  or   the  games will be on sundays from    mostly some
   games starting on september  th 
the other issue i need you to ponder is lst division vs  nd division  i
know at our last game we decided to stay in  nd but what i did not know at
the time is it will cause the green room to be ineligible for a league
championship  for  years  if we are lst or  nd in our league since we did
not promote our team to lst division  i guess one way around this is to
change our name and manager  nay volunteers   and then i doubt the league
would know who we are even though we are basically the old green room team
or just to try out lst division and see how it goes and try and get a few
more power players to make us even better  please respond to me by telling
me if you think we should stay in  nd or move up to lst  also send me
money  thanks
