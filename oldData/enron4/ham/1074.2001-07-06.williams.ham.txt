bill 
kate and i are still working on mpc  s march checkouts  that was the messy month that we had discrepancies almost every day and i sent out a big e  mail to the whole group and listed problems with the names of who was on shift that day 
when we finish the mpc checkout  you should see a credit for     for the purchase side 
thanks

if this deal was zeroed out  and it has been after the fact   then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from mpc  the other side of the deal 
deal     we should only lose    the net difference   any ideas 
thanks

during our month  end processes i have researched deal      the counterparty did change as bill pointed out  but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for he   originally the deal liquidated with he    mwh      he    mwh      and he    mwh      but on      the volume for he  was zeroed out in scheduling  which means originally you were given too much  for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in he  back 
thanks

i have one question on this month  s pma and some questions from last month  first  for deal    this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty tacomasupp  this counterparty was then changed to tacomapubuit  why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue  are we being charged for each counterparty again  like ees and st  cali last month   if so  we need to fix this flawed tool 
second  for last month  we determined that the wbom book needs a     pma for change in price  the appropriate price is in enpower  but the revenue has never appeared  deal     remember  this deal was originally input as a buy at   and a sell at   and liquidated at these prices  the deal is now at   and    what do we need to do to get this trued up 
please come see me with questions 
thank you for your help
