Subject fw  can you check a deal for me
bill 
mpc looked again and does not show this deal  most of the houston coordinators have responded and they have no discrepancies  purchase or sale  on march  th  there are  who i  m awaiting responses from still 
i  ll let you know if i find either side  right now  i  m inclined to think the inc sheet is wrong and there was no deal at that hour  can you or kate check with the trader who  booked  the deal at he  and let him search his notes and explain why the mw volumes and prices changed that he in the inc sheet when there is no further documentation     
thanks
