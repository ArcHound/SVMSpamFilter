Subject today  s iso call on implementation of june  order
here are a couple of the highlights of today  s iso call 
  the iso expects generators that are incapable of ramping up within  minutes to remain online at all times 
  because of software limitations  marketers are still capable of setting the mcp  the iso hopes to fix this within a few weeks  at the earliest 
  the iso plans to publish the emission costs this week that will be charged to scs for demand within california 
  scs scheduling wheel  through transactions or exports out of california will not be subject to emission or start  up fuel costs 
  the iso is dispatching generators during both emergency and non  emergency hours 
  for purposes of determining when a new stage  has occurred  the iso requires a minimum of  minutes   minutes before the operating hour plus the operating hour 
  under this requirement  the iso could be in stage  for up to  minutes without triggering a new stage  that is capable of resetting the proxy price 
if you have any questions  let me know
