there are two databases which i cannot locate 
west realtime
wscc outages
however  i did locate 
real time operations  ectpdx  lnl  ect  realtime  myaccoun  nsf  would this be the correct database  
realtime  ecthou  ln   ect  mail  realtime  nsf
for wscc outages and west realtime databases  if you could locate someone who does have access to these databases and ask them to do the following 
close the database icon
right  click on the database icon
choose file  database  properties
then send me the title  server  and filename information  this will be of great help 
many thanks and please advise
