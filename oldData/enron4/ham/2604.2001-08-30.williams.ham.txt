subject  august hourly bloomberg deals still not cleared
please find attached an excel spreadsheet of bloomberg deals i can  t seem to match up with our deals in enpower  this is for august  through august   none of these deals have bloomberg as the broker in enpower  i was told in june to allow a two day grace period before the deals should be in enpower and that did not occur 
please let me know if there is anything i can do to help resolve these problems
