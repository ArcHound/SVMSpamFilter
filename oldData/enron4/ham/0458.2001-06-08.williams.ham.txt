i checked with lvc on tube materials and condenser operating conditions for unit    unit   has had no indication of corrosion but the water used for cooling tower makeup is well water and is low in chlorides

the drainage ditch issue is still precipated by the eventuality that a sound wall will be constructed  if the sound wall is constructed there will have to be a minimum distance that must be maintained above the  foot  the added cost for higher  larger towers have to be considred  the drainage ditch will not be constructed for four years in the future so the transmission lines cannot extend into the easement area 
however  if we put the culverts in now before transmission lines are constructed then the city may allow the penetration into the easement 
for sure if we hang transmission lines into the facility site we will get an interference claim from the contractor 
i will investigate farther the recommended change in condenser materials  as it now stands we are only asking for the additional costs  i have checked the scope of work and it is silent on the tube spec  by copy the wisdom and chemielwski please provide the technical justification for the change in materials  in the days when i was a member of nace ss was not recommendeed in any service that had chlorides in excess of  ppm due to stress cracks caused by the chlorides
