fyi  attached is a complaint filed by care on april  against bc hydro  powerex  mirant and bpa  with the ladwp thrown in as an unnamed respondent   the complaint is principally directed against bc hydro and powerex  it essentially accuses bc hydro and powerex of manipulating the reservoirs in bc and transmission capacity reserved by powerex on the bpa system to cob and nob to withhold power during a period of peak demand  to contrive a shortage and test their market power   care accuses bc hydro and powerex of violating section  of the fpa  state and federal anti  trust laws  the civil rights of californians under title vi of the civil rights act of  and nafta 
the complaint is long on sensational allegations and short on facts  the evidence proffered in the complaint consists of a rant off the yahoo message board by an unnamed power trader in spokane  we think it is an avista trader   selected transmission data from the iso  the la times article of april    regarding the iso  s report on powerex  bpa and ladwp  the iso report itself  and bc hydro  s residential rate schedule  care requests ferc to initiate an investigation  seeks unspecified refunds and punitive damages and also appears to want ferc to have the secretary of doe declare an emergency under section   c  of the fpa and compel deliveries of electricity 
ferc has noticed the complaint and has established may  as the due date for interventions and responses
