Subject fw  lousiana pacific deal    
traders 
after speaking with risk and recognizing many inconsistencies in the way that the following deals were done  i have made the following changes that will affect your books 
there will be no deals on the st w hourly books 
st nw will show only pge purchase deal      offset by swap between st nw and lt nw  
all other deals                      and     have been changed to the lt nw book 
i hope this will make things easier

august     virginia set deal     back to  mw  keeping sale to lp whole  and entered deal     to buy back  mw of lp energy at   of the price sold real time        split according to agreement with lp  
vt routed original purchase from pge  deal     st nw  back to lousiana pacific  deal      lt nw  and routed the  buy  back  deal      st w hourly  to wwp and to puget  st w hourly
