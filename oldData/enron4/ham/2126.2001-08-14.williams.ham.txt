Subject a few reminders    
bill  does this sound reasonable  do you have anything to add 
please make a note of the following  i know we have several new traders  and details often get overlooked in the midst of the learning process  but this is not only information for the new guys a reminder for the old that attention to detail is an important part of the job  thanks

  bloomberg deals need to be assigned a   flat broker fee per trade  if you begin a deal with bloomberg trades  enter a per  megawatt fee  and extend the deal later with bilateral trades  you  re effectively charging yourself extra brokerage because that fee will be assigned to every mw in your deal  can someone come up with a compelling reason why we wouldn  t simply multiply   times the number of bloomberg trades done  please let me know 
  most importantly  if you are unsure  call someone who is 
thanks again for your attention to these matters
