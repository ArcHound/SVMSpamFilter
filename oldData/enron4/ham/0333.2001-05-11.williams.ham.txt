Subject revised ees position   
after consulting with our california scheduling team to determine why    volumes on our spreadsheet were not matching up with yours  i have revised my sheet  and i think you  ll find this new one more fitting    
also  the    sheet has been revised slightly  namely  the np   transmission column  daniel  per our conversation this morning  the np   and sp   on peak prices happened to be the same on this day  so they are correct as you see them in the sheet 
please call me with questions 
thanks 
kate
