chris and heather 
i wanted to let you all know that i have added some replacement deals to the st ca and st w hourly books that we spoke about yesterday  below is an explanation of why  and i have listed the old deals and the replacement deals      
st w services sold a position to the st ca book and st st w hrly desks  but the energy didn  t flow due to a scheduled outage  since the energy didn  t flow  the desks entered some sales to wheelabrator to sell back the energy that didn  t flow  this sale should have been to the st w services book to sell back the position  not to wheelabrator  i zero  d out the sales to wheelabrator and entered intra  desk annuities  please see below
