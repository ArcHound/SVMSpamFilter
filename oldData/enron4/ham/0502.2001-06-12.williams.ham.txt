 yes  that  s right  you did raise your hand for this 

 we are to submit to isas any recommendation  s  by august      what
 was the date  i didn  t write it down  

 is there benefit to have a face  to  face meeting  either way  we  ll use
 e  mail for discussion and maybe a conference call or two 

 first assignment is to read 
  a  al  interim is what we are currently running with 
  a  al  version   draft  goes before the nerc bot june    
  a  al  candr contains public comments and responses from nerc is 

   a  alcandr  doc  
 questions to keep in mind 
  are our current timelines as good as it gets 
  do we want to adopt the eastern interconnection  s timelines 
  what are the deficiencies of our timelines 
  will these deficiencies be present under    
  which timing requirements could be changed with an reasonable amount
 of effort  i  e   tariff items  agc ramp times  a  al  etc   

 remember
