 hi green roomers 

 the fall outdoor soccer season is just around the corner and the schedules
 have been posted to the gpsd website at
 http    www  gpsdsoccer  com 
 you will be surprised to learn  like i was  that we were not promoted to
the
 lst division  it seems that the league has decided to keep us in  nd even
 though i registered for and said we would accept the promotion to lst
 division in order to be eligible for the championship 

 our first game is on sunday sept   th at delta park    ne of strasser  at
     all of the rest of the games in the  game season will also be at
    and will occur every sunday between sept  th and november  th with
 the exception of sunday october  st when we have a bye  we then will
have
 a championship game in early december since we will win the league again 
 right 

 don  t forget to update your player care if you had a recent birthday or
are
 new to the team  you update or get a player card at the oasa league
office
 off of highway  at the sylvan exit  they do have odd hours so call them
 before you head up there 

 anyway that is enough from me  see you soon out on the soccer pitch
