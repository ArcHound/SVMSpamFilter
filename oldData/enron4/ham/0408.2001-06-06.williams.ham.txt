subject  pma  s
heather i have gone through the pma  s and portions of them look appropriate  however  i would appreciate it if you could look into a couple of deals for me 
first 
st  whourly
       deal   and   when mark guzman originally made these deals he neglected to put in a  mw purchase from wwp at   for he     he also neglected to put in the  mw sale to wesco at    the pma shows the cost for the  mw purchase from wwp at    but does not show the revenue from the  mw sale to wesco at    these changes were put in at the same time on the same day per virginia  this is approximately     
       deal    david porter originally put this deal in as a buy from st  cali  the deal should have been a buy from ees  i changed the counterparty only  approximately  hours after the flash  the charge of   is the entire charge for the deal   mws at   for he      if i am charged by ees  i believe i should receive revenue from st  cali for the expense that went out with the flash 
st  wbom
       deal    geir solberg entered a buy  resale for   and      i corrected this to  and  for a difference of   on       this represents a     change for the better 
there may be more  but this is all i have for now 
again  i appreciate you taking the time to look into these 
thanks 
bill
