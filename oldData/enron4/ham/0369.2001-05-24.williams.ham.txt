Subject anyone else read this 
has anyone  or everyone  read the latest business practice proposal
that was released by nerc on tuesday  it is esc  s scheduling and approval
practices submitted by the multiple task groups  scheduling process 
approval  schedule timing  granularity and ramping task groups 
specifically  they are recommending changing the ramp time to a
  minute straddle ramp    to     in addition  they  re recommending
allowing schedule changes on the quarter  as already exists at      
   with a  minute ramp  their reasoning is  and this is a quote   large
generators that require longer ramp times  e  g   or  minutes   could
partially ramp for  minutes across the schedule start  then finish with
another   minute ramp across the next quarter to complete the full ramp 
this would accommodate areas such as florida and wscc  where longer ramp
times are needed  
their asking for feedback for the public posting  this proposal has
a serious impact on our recommendations  anyone have any comments  i  m
attaching a copy of the document  it  s  pages long  about  of them on
frag tags  the ramping stuff and recommendations are the last couple of
