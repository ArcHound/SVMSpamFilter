Subject delano for monday    
gentlemen 
delano is prescheduled to return from their outage beginning he  on monday      however  if you can buy the energy back he     below    their variable costs   please do so  if prices warrant  you will purchase  mw  spl   he     i will tee up delano for this play  please stay in contact with the control room to let them know what  s going on 
as far as the price goes  we proposed to delano that we would split the profit with them  so  split the delta between what you  re able to buy for  and their variable costs      for example  if you  re able to purchase the energy at    put in a purchase from whoever at    then a sale to delano at    giving delano    and real  time     the services desk  out of the goodness of our hearts   is not going to take anything from this transaction 
we have one more issue with delano on monday  he    they are prescheduled at  mw  but they will be able to produce  mw  so we will possibly have  mw to sell for them  they are going to let me know what they want to do  they will either have us sell it real  time  run uninstructed against the iso dec   or ramp down their generation to reflect their preschedule 
i will keep you posted on what they want to do 
thanks
