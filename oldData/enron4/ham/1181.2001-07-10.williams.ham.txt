subject  donnie vinson thanks you for your als donations   
i would like to thank everyone that contributed to the beach bowl  for als  my grandmother passed away from this debilitating disease in  and since then there has been only one small breakthrough in the treatment  hopefully with your donations and those of others we can make a difference for those suffering from als  it means a great deal to me that you were able to help out even though the event was so far away from portland  thank you again for your support and i miss everyone
