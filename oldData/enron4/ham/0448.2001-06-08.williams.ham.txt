Subject willamet  pac deal on     
dear bill  kate  and les 
i wanted to let you all know what we are doing concerning deals      purchase from willamet  and     sale to pace  
i believe that we are all now familiar with the details of these deals  mike  geir  les  and i have spent a combined  hours or more researching this deal over the last month  our last resort is to pull the tapes  as we do not have access to our tapes and i am not sure when we will have them back  we have decided to do the following until we have the tapes back and can verify that the sale to pac did take place 
 i have extended the sale of  mw  s of willamet generation to pac to include he  
 i have temporarily zero  d out the he    piece of this deal on the pac side with notes
as the payment is  months overdue  we will pay now and get reimbursed if we find that we are correct 
please share any thoughts with me that you may have 
thanks to everyone for your help in researching this
