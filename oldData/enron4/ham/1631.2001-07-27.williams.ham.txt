Subject path confirmation testing of latest release
good afternoon 
i am looking at version        the day i was checking was initally june   but switched over to june  th  new data 
text wrapping 
the text wraps in the following fields 
counterparty
tag
comments
the text does not consistently wrap in the path field  which is the most critical field to have wrap 
missing transmission information   june  th re  ran to check this 
the transmission information from transl  transloasis seems to be coming thru  inconsistently   and i still do not see the transmission information from trans   trans  oasis represented  i re  ran my data from the  th to check it but when  i went to delete my data for the  th  and there was none there  do you all know if this data was purposefully removed  or did it just go away  the only data that seems to have survived to this version is the data from    
sorting 
by tag  i see how to make it sort in the strip  but cannot just look at tag numbers  right now in lotus  if i activate the sort by tag i get a list  and if i just start typing a tag number  it takes me to the one i want  can we have that capability duplicated 
by global id  this needs to be able to be done in the upper sort area 
expanded view 
will the path size in the expanded view be fixed in the next release  i still cannot see the whole path 
the delivery point is blank when i pull this up  but i populated border  and   what drives this 
path cut   working in june  th data 
i was able to sucessfully cut a path  but with the following problems
  region still needs to be the forced choice that i mentioned in earlier e  mails
  after a path is cut  and i go into the original path  i can  t see any way to easily find the cut associated with the path  maybe a  go to cut  button
  i would like to be able to add incremental hours to a cut  as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time  a new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut 
question  in the expanded view of the path under counterparty  i see a name of a person kind of greyed out  who is this person  it does not match the trader name on the deal  i looked at williams deal      janelle barsness shows in the path expanded view  but no trader is visible in the trade  done on eol   i looked at wapa deal      kathy crane is in the path expanded view  and penny casey is their trader 
that  s all for now  catch you all on monday
