subject  party at pge park  assistance needed
we have a fantastic opportunity for employees of our sponsors and suite
holder companies  due to last minute scheduling conflicts  a large
block of our volunteers for the party at pge park this coming friday had
to cancel  this has obviously created some last minute challenges for
pge park  but it is a great opportunity for your employees to volunteer
a few hours of their time on behalf of some great causes plus see the
four tops and the spinners in concert for free  here  s how 
party at pge park is a fundraiser for the portland oregon sports
authority  solv  and special olympics oregon 
we are about  volunteers short to assist with serving the vip dinner 
volunteers would work from    p  m  to    p  m  on assisting with the
pre  concert food service 
in exchage  each volunteer will get two free tickets to that evenings 
concert plus a voucher for a free hot dog  chips  and soda 
this opportunity is open to your employees and spouses  significant
others  or other adult family members  we  re sorry  but children cannot
volunteer for this particular opportunity
