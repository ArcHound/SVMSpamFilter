  yes  that  s right  you did raise your hand for this 
 
  we are to submit to isas any recommendation  s  by august      what
  was the date  i didn  t write it down  
 
  is there benefit to have a face  to  face meeting  either way  we  ll use
  e  mail for discussion and maybe a conference call or two 
 
  first assignment is to read 
   a  al  interim is what we are currently running with 
   a  al  version   draft  goes before the nerc bot june    
   a  al  candr contains public comments and responses from nerc is 
 
     a  alcandr  doc  
  questions to keep in mind 
   are our current timelines as good as it gets 
   do we want to adopt the eastern interconnection  s timelines 
   what are the deficiencies of our timelines 
   will these deficiencies be present under    
   which timing requirements could be changed with an reasonable amount
  of effort  i  e   tariff items  agc ramp times  a  al  etc   
 
  remember
