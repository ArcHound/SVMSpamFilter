Subject ncpa br is back
hey guys 
i had a long talk with ncpa today and set up so that we again can do the zp   npl  buy  resale on a realtime basis  we are not doing a profit split this time  we are paying them    mw instead  this basically enables us to shift  mw across pathl  and not be subject to congestion as ncpa has grandfather rights across the path  this is a sweet strategy when the spl   npl  spread is there and pathl  is congested  ncpa  s capacity is  mw  but i would not recommend doing more than  mw  there are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it  wesco especially   so by doing only  mw we do not remind them of ncpa 
the way this works is that we call ncpa and ask their capacity across pathl   and tell them you want to schedule the br through whatever hour 
in caps 
we sell to ncpa in zp  
we buy from ncpa in npl  
we can buy spl  to fill our zp  sale  we just shift the load from spl  to zp   so enter a epmi calpool  
pg  e is ncpa  s sc  so if you are not passing phase two give them a call 
ncpa  s tel        
pg  e tel        
if you guys have any questions just ask me
