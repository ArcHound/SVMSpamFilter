Subject losses at kyrene    
lisa 
i  m trying to figure out why two deals entered to cover losses at kyrene for the  st of may didn  t make it into the preschedule sheet  i  m looking for the following deals 
  stsw buys epe
pv
hlh   mw   
comments  losses at kyrene
  stsw buys epe
pv
hlh   mw   
comments  delivery at kyrene
these deals are pulling into the carp report  but are not shown in either the preschedule or real time el paso models  therefore  enpower is showing more volume and a higher total cost for the day than our model  can you give me a hint on this one 
thanks
