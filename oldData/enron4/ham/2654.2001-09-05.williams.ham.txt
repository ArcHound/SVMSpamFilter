Subject testing the psw and path confirm report
good morning  afternoon  evening 
i started working in june  to test path cut capabilities  i was able to save a cut path 
please make sure that bill williams iii and whomever he designates has access to enpower testp so that i can walk them through the app when it is ready  right now it looks like mark guzman and kate symes will be the voice of west real time 
a real time question 
when enpower is taken down for maintenance  as it sometimes is at night  will this application still function  if not  we need to find a way for the real time crew to be able to access this information when enpower is being maintained 
re  running june  th as a completely new day  this entire test was done in local enpower
preschedule workspace 
running build route report 
criteria selection  unable to select criteria for build route  got  list index out of bounds     error  needs fix
error checking  took     produced a line by line error sheet that is printable   accepted
but routing errors for lines    in the cob sheet produced a routing error that just states  error   no reason  we need to know why an error is shown  was run after all routes were deleted   needs fix

path confirmation 
speed is very much an issue here  i had mark guzman sit with me while i cut a path and when i confirmed a group of paths  the confirmation of  paths as a group took  seconds from the time i entered the name and hit the  ok  button until the confriming was completed  this is too long  we need this to be    seconds max  currently  this process takes about  seconds in lotus 
cutting a path went fast enough until i closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report  this also took over a minute  this is another  second process in lotus 
one little housekeeping thing  can we move the delete button away from the confrim button  perhaps on the other side of the exit button  this will save us mucho headaches later  or make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion 
real time discussion 
where are we on this  i heard initial rumblings  but nothing lately
