Subject iso compliance filing on june  ferc order
all 
i have reviewed documents from the iso  s website regarding forced outages as they relate to the june  ferc order and concluded the following 
   during a system emergency  a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the participating generator does not notify the iso of the outage within the operating hour of the outage  and
   during a non  system emergency  a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour 
if you have any questions at all  i can be reached at extension  
thanks 
donna
