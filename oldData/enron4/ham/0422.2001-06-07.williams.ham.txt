Subject supplementals for       
group 
due to the recent drop in day  ahead prices  we have a few counterparties who scheduled less than their p  max generation  therefore  we need to submit supplemental bids so they will be covered in case the iso calls on their generation  for the difference between the p  max and their prescheduled generation  
additionally  if you can make an sc to sc trade with this generation please do  if you are able to do an sc trade  please make sure it  s for at least a  hour run  make sure you  re in contact with the control rooms to let them know what you  re doing  and if you do make an sc to sc trade  don  t forget to take out the supplemental bids for those hours 
so  please submit supplemental bids  or sell as an sc to sc trade for harbor  delano  wheelabrator martel  and sierra pacific industries
