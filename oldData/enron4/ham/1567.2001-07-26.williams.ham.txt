dear traders 
please be advised that the following worksheet is a summary of transmission ancillary charges  these charges are above and beyond the normal price for transmission and do not include transmission reservation charges in them  to figure approximately how much each mw of transmission will cost when all charges have been applied  use the following worksheet  adding each of the  ancillary charges that apply to the transmission cost 
for example 
i reserve  mw  s of sierra pacific transmission 
scheduling fees    mw  s x        
reactive supply and voltage fees     x     x   x       
line losses     x  mw  s x  anticipate average energy cost so far this month  circa       
  please note that if energy prices are higher  this line loss charge will be higher too  ie  if prices are at    this charge will be     
total ancillary      for  mw  s      per mw hour of transmission
attached is the worksheet
