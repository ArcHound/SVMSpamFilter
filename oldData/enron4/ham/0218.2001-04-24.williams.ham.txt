Subject montana power company march 
dear real  timers 
we are having the same problem with montana power  s checkout as we had last month  the volume of disputes is overwhelming  
i have looked at the inc sheets and found that enpower matches the inc  sheets 
but in fairness to mpc  s disputes  last month when i trusted the inc sheets  and i pulled the tapes  i found that our inc  sheets were wrong in a number of places 
mike and i are doing the march  checkout and are having trouble finding your logs  your notebooks  or any information regarding the dates in question 
i am listing below the dates and he that we are having disputes for  please look at your logs and let me know the mw value  price  and who you spoke to at mpc at what time  please do not give me what the inc sheets say  as mike and i have already looked at them 
i expect an answer from each of you asap
