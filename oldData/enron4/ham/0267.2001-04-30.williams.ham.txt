you will get stopped out  i talked to david port today because last year we spent a lot of time cleaning up gas var and now we must spend the time fixing power var  however  until its fixed i have no choice but to use the reported numbers

the numbers being generated for the west  s var do not comport with what i believe our risk to be  i think that it may have to do with the correlation across months and across locations  for example  the ltnw book has a grant total of mwh from now through september on  peak and    mwh from now through september off  peak  the var report shows mike with   million of var   about   million of it coming between now and september  we have a total var of   million  with about   million between now and september  by my rough calculations  we would have to have the entire curve move roughly    mwh in one day for this var to be accurate  that means that once every  days the entire summer curve   peak and off  peak   would have to move in excess of    mwh  i might add that we are short q  which i  m not giving us any credit for as an offset 
i understand that there is a lot of risk on our books  i just don  t think that it is as much as the var model is spitting out  wierd things happen in the var model and option valuation models due to the interaction of the blending formula on the volatility and the correlations as we approach delivery  we see the same thing with option valuations  we see option model valuations  e  g   transmission spread options  going through the roof when they are trading for fractions of our model valuations in reality  similarly  the var model valuations move up really fast as the summer approaches 
bottom line  i need to know what you want us to do  we are chewing up a lot of var  if we are going to get stopped out i need to know now  i think that it would be a shame to close out of a largely spread position that wouldn  t necessarily have any practical impact on our real profitability but would make the  model  happy
