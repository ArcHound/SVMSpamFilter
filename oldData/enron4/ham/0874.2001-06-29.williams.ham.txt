Subject el paso schedule for    and     extremely problematic
this sheet is as complete as possible  and i am worried about it due to the following circumstances 
  the dispatch sheet that comes to real time was  mw flat on sunday and llh on monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged today 
  the four corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between    and     from  mw long to flat  i tried to resolve the four corners schedules with psco  who
told me they did not have a purchase from epe in july  i tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to enron each time  lisa had a buy resale with pnm at four corners  but that booked out and did not seem to match the  long that i saw in the dispatch sheet  i spoke with pete  who assured me that the sale to psco was good for the summer 
  i still was unable to resolve the  mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew  and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule  no epe representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules  and i was referred by a dispatch person to call on saturday and speak to carlos when he came in at  pm  i was very uncomfortable doing this  and so in my desperation called roger at home  who after some discussion with steve at his home confirmed that the extrat  flat sunday and llh monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on july   i trust his assesment  and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet 
between all of the preschedulers today at enron  we have spent over  hours dealing with the epe schedules today 
the sheet is as complete as i possibly can find justification for
