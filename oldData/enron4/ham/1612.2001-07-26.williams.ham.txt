Subject saturday frontier energy payback
real time traders 
this saturday    frontier needs to repay bpa for control area reserves that where used on    and     the total frontier owes is  mw  i  ve arranged with bpa to return  mw on peak for saturday 
however  this payback needs to be done real time as bpa  s ability to take the energy is dependant on their system operations 
the real time procedure is as follows 
  call the bpa real time power scheduler at      around  or  and tell him you are calling to schedule energy imbalance paybacks from frontier energy for  mw on peak  if bpa can take the schedule try to get them to commit to take all  hours  then call bpa real time transmission and buy a  mw wheel using account   for energy imbalance paybacks to bpa merchant 
if bpa is unable to take the  mw schedule for any hour please sell it real time for the best price in the northwest 
  in enpower enter a buy from frontier at zero price and note in the comments section that this is a energy imbalance payback deal  enter a sale to bpa at zero price and note in the comments section that this is a energy imbalance payback deal  extend bpa transmission deal  to include the additional  mw 
call me if there are questions or problems  we tried to do this payback last saturday and the energy just went inadvertent for  hours because we didn  t call bpa
