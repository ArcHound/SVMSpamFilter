we are missing an id  s from st  wbom to st  cali for saturday  we sold  mws to st  cali at      this should be the same as friday  s deal    we either need a new deal for saturday or need to make friday  s on  peak deal carry over into saturday 
if you are changing the friday deal you need to do it before the flash  otherwise if you make a new deal for saturday you should have some time 
thanks for the help
