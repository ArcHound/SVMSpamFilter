my response to the questions would be that they get the proxy price during
the mitigated intervals when they do not have a bid in  if they have a bid
in  they get the higher of the proxy or the bid and they submit the cost
justification to ferc  right 
who do they send cost justification to

 k 

 i wanted to document what just happened on receiving a dispatch
 instruction from the iso for harbor cogen  harbgn    units   at   
 we received a dispatch instruction from he iso due to the stage 
 emergency  the request was for  mw from tosco and  mw from harbor 


 as you know  we are no longer the sc for tosco and have sent you the
 required documentation  can you make sure the iso has this in their
 system 

 with respect to harbor  we were running  mw and were inc  d  
 indicating a request for a total of  mw  we already had an approved
 outage request from the iso as indicated by the fax i sent you
 indicating that harbor only had  mw available  so  the iso should
 only have been able to dispatch  mw 

 we initially declined the dispatch instruction from the iso due to the
 errors the iso made and the confusion it caused us  we immediately
  hit the phones  to clarify the facts and subsequently inc  d
 generation to  mw by     why did the iso dispatch group not have
 our outage request indicating a maximum of  mw 

 we believe we have completely responded to the iso  s instruction and
 should have no penalty charges  please let me know the settlement
 implications of this confusion event 

 thanks

 chris
