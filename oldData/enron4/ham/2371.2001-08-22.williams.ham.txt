Subject arco outage on thursday    
real  timers 
arco is going down for a few hours in the morning on thursday     to conduct some maintenance  they are prescheduled at  mw  but from he     they will only be able to produce  mw  so  please reduce their generation schedule  and purchase  mw  he     in spl  for them 
also  for he     of those  mw that you purchase for arco  please sell  mw to st west services  deal     and then sell to arco  deal    for the same price that you sold to west services  the remainder just sell straight to arco  this needs to be done because there were some funky schedule adjustments by the iso  basically  the iso cut arco  s day  ahead schedule by  mw for he     so west services had wear that in order for the day  ahead enpower to caps report to tie out 
one more thing  the iso also adjusted several other generator schedules for he     on thursday      i emailed the generators who were affected  sierra  wheelabrator martel  and nove   i told them that we resubmitted all their schedules in the hour ahead market  and that we were relatively confident that their preferred schedules would be awarded hour ahead  but if they so desired  they could call into the real  time desk one hour before the flow to check the hour  ahead final  that way the could make any adjustments to their generation if necessary  so  you might get a few calls in the middle of the night from a few generators to check their final hour  ahead schedules  but to be honest  i highly doubt you  ll get any calls  i know you won  t get a call from nove or sierra  if you do get a call it might be from wheelabrator martel 
thanks a bunch
