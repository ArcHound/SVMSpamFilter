  we would like to try to buy  back the first few hours for something under      what they sold for day  ahead  we  ll use their day  ahead price rather than their generation costs because we sold day  ahead for slightly below their generation costs of     in order to make money with this buy  back strategy and selling  mw from the steam turbine in real  time   so  please try to buy  back  he     or through hel  if prices warrant    mw  spl   treat this like the delano buy  back  where we split the profit with the customer  please stay in contact with the control room to communicate which hour they are supposed to come up for 
  we need to sell  mw from the steam turbine in real  time  the steam turbine can only be started up  hours after the gas turbine is fired up  on the back end  it can shut down the same hour that the gas turbine shuts down  so  please sell  mw  spl   beginning  hours after the gas turbine comes on  for example  if you bring the gas turbine on beginning hel   please begin selling the steam turbine hel  through he
