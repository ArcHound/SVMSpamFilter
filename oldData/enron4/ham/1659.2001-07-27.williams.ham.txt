Subject fw  summary of scheduling problems we discussed on july   
the two dispatcher log entries show that enron requested operating reserves
for the same contingency the occurred about    on june  th  they
continued to request reserves for several subsequent hours for the same
contingency  note also  that mcc was called about the first contingency at
   but no request for reserves was made 
in listening to the voice recorder 
  mark called at    and said he had been calling  casey  at munro
all day with reliability problem reports and requesting operating reserves 
finally  he was directed to call the dittmer generation dispatcher  mark
said he had fuel problems and needed reserves  he also wanted to know who
to call for reporting hourly actual generation because we told him that the
hourly reporting had stopped at   seems they were calling munro with
this information also 
  burt called at    and asked for more operating reserves for the
same    contingency of fuel problems  we said no  they are allowed to
use operating reserves only through hel  due the time of the event being
    they must call the tbl real  time scheduler and change transmission
schedules 
bernie  bpa  then called our rt schedulers to convey the previous events 
rt schedulers told bernie that the enron schedulers hung up on them and did
not change any of the transmission schedules when the rt schedulers refused
to provide any more operating reserves
