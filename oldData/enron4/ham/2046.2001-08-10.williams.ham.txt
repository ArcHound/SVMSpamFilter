Subject forward obligations report issues
bill 
following are two glitches the real time group has run across with the forward obs report  as i understand  dave poston is getting set to roll out a new version of enpower position manager  which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run  forward obs included   but in the meantime these are the problems we  ve seen  thanks so much for your help on this 
  report not reading two identical strips  when deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours  same volume  same price and same counterparty  using the same deal number   the report only reads one strip  for example  on       deal  was previously entered as a sale to the california imbalance for  mw he    and two separate but identical strips of  mw for he     the report read all  mw he     but only  mw he     i zeroed out one  mw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read all  mw 
another example  on       deal  is a purchase from ees he    which was also entered as two separate strips of  mw each  again  the report read only one of these  and i eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total of  mw for those hours 
due to the nature of real time deal entry  high volume and a lot of deal extension in scheduling  it would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price  so i  m hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms  please let me know if this is feasible 
  report not reading sales at the bc border  this is a new one that cropped up this morning  we made a purchase from a counterparty at the bpa busbar  wheeled the power to the bc border and sold it there  for some reason  although all three deals        appear in deal entry and scheduling  the sale at the bc border does not show up in the forward obligation report  after looking into this  i  ve found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that deal  is simply not pulling into the report  i  m wondering if this is related to deals done at the bc border  although i don  t recall seeing this problem before 
again  please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed  i look forward to our next conference call    
thanks
