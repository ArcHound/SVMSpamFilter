Subject new generation report questionaire
hello 
i am taking over responsibility for the monthly new generation report previously compiled by jeffrey oh  i would appreciate your feedback so that i can better tailor the report to your specific needs  all comments will be given serious consideration  but may not necessarily be implemented in a future version of the report 
  for what purposes do you use this report   i  e   tracking total new capacity by region  following specific plants  companies  monitoring changes in implied heat rates  etc  
  what would you like to see more or less of in the report   i  e   more news stories  less cartography  more graphs  etc  
  would you use an online version of the newsletter that could be customized to your specific needs 
  would it be valuable if the report were updated more frequently   i  e   weekly or bi  monthly 
  do you know of anyone else who may be interested in receiving the report 
thank you for your feedback  any additional comments  questions are welcome
