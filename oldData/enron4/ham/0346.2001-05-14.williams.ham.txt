Subject inter  desk deals        
i  ve killed the cal  imbalance deal i entered under short term west bom for       as well as the inter  desk swap between stca and west bom   
i double  checked real time position manager and the forward obligations report for this day  and all looks fine  i  ll keep my fingers crossed that it remains that way until tomorrow morning 
please let me know if you have questions
