grace 
hello  were very excited that you have decided to except our invitation  
due to the large traffic of companies that week because of the business
career fair  we will be having two speakers at the meeting on september 
 your company and enterprise   since enterprise accepted first we will have
them present first 
we were thinking that we would a lot you both up to  minutes  it doesn  t
have to be that long though  feel free to present whatever you would like 
some examples of what you could talk about    your companies history 
positions recruiting for  what your looking for in a candidate  what a makes
a resume stand out  a questions and answer section  etc 
feel free to bring treats  or little company toys like the ones handed out
at job fairs  i think enterprise was thinking about bringing pizza 
feel free to contact me with any other questions  i will get in touch with
you when the date gets closer to finalize everything 
sincerely 
colleen gibson
