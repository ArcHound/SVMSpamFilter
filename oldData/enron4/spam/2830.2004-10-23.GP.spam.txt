west africa  my husband is isaac nuhan vaye  deputy
minister of public works  liberia  my husband was falsely
accused of plotting to remove the then president of liberia
 charles taylor  from office  without trial  charles taylor
killed him  you can verify this from your country  you can
also check in some of the international newspapers posted
in the web sites below 
 ii  http    www  unwire  org  unwire        asp
before my husband was killed  he moved out the sum of    
million through a diplomatic means  and deposited it with a
security company abroad  all that is needed is for my
lawyer to instruct the company to transfer the funds to
your account  i will remunerate you with   at the end of
the transaction  but most of all is that i solicit your
trust in this transaction 
i have been confined only to our country home and all my
