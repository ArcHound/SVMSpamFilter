 ocation
over the weekend and ensign dri   ing has spudded the        w  m we  
a
nd are currentiy driiling at    o feet  surface casing wil  be run to
 feet  the drilling rig is known as a telescopic double and is rated
to dri   to lo   o feet in depth  drilling operations are expected to
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the county may impose a
restriction
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring
breakup
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage  this is an annual
event 
which occurs in most of central and northern canada when the frost 
which
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground  drilling operations
for
a  arge rig such as the sylvan lake wel  requires service by heavy
vehicies
such as mud  water  cement and vacuum trucks which wiil be prohibited
from
using the roads during this period of time  peter sanders notes 
§ the road bans that have been taking piace ail over alberta happen
every year
and in the spring is no surprise  a   oi  and gas companies are
effected by
breakup  the good thing is  is that we have the rig on site  which wi  
remain there until we are finished dri   ing  surface casing has been
compieted and we wiil be ready to finish driliing the minute the road
bans are  ifted
