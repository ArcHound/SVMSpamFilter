with oil prices now well over   and near  constant international
instability highlighting the vulnerability of the us and world economies to
petroleum supply shortages  the use of renewable  alternative energy sources has
taken on new and immediate importance  
some of the most widespread and feasible of these new technologies are
already being incorporated into everyday usage  foremost among these is the use
of ethanol fuel as an oxygenator in petroleum to reduce emissions and as an
alternative fuel source  ethanol is already blended in approximately  
of us gasoline as an environmental additive  while the use of rfg  reformulated
gasoline  could more than double demand  according to industry estimates 
in  the use of ethanol fuel helped to reduce the average cost of gasoline by
nearly  cents per gallon  while it reduced over  million tons of
co   equivalent greenhouse gas emissions  government regulatory measures
including epact and clean air standards  as well as new policies banning the use
of mtbte are acting as a major catalyst towards ethanol industry growth  with an
estimated    billion gallons used in the us in   demand is expected to
skyrocket to more than  billion by  
in spite of this tremendous and growing demand  however  there is a
significant and serious ethanol supply crunch  driving up prices of ethanol on
the open market  spurring major government interest and wall street
investment  ethanol production has traditionally been a costly and complex
endeavor  requiring heavy subsidies to coax producers to ramp up their
operations to meet demand  there are currently  ethanol plants in the
us  capable of producing    billion gallons annually  a figure that is barely
adequate to meet current demand  let alone keep up with future demand  the
ethanol industry is struggling to meet this demand with  additional plants and
an annual capacity of  million gallons already under construction  it
is no surprise then  that the street is eagerly awaiting new investment
opportunities in the ethanol and clean energy industries  a trend which has been
validated by the recent high  profile   million merger of pacific ethanol 
inc   nasdaq  peix  with accessity corp  to form the first us  based pure  play
ethanol company 
with this in mind  we would like to introduce you to our newest profile
company  trinity technologies  inc   otc pink sheets  tntg   a name which you
