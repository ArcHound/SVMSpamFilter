Subject no more fad diets  loose it the right way  loose it forever
did you know that you could cut your food right down to  calories and still gain weight 
eat   burn only  and you will gain weight  even though you  re constantly hungry 
on the other hand  you could eat say    calories and loose a lot of weight  if you burn   
which has less to do with exercise and mostly has to do with your metabolism 
boost your metabolism effectively and loose those unwanted pounds 
do some moderate exercise while taking it and loose even more pounds naturally and rapidly 
everyone that has ever lost a lot of weight knows that this is the only prooven way to loose and
keep the pounds off 
just dieting or exersing is simply not enough if you have a slow matabolism due to your genes
