one biometric company  facekey corp  appears to be on the
forefront of making a difference  facekey corp  trading on the otc under
the ticker symbol feky  headquartered in san antonio texas  this
biometric company combines face and fingerprint recognition technology
which can be used in both the public and private sectors  coo annette
starkweather exclaims by effectively combining both fingerprint and
facial recognition  facekey is targeting the two largest revenue producing
areas in the biometrics industry today while establishing patented
technology to forge the future of biometric applications 
according to the international biometrics group  ibg   an independent
market research firm  the total biometrics market was   million in
  biometrics is anticipated to grow to approximately     billion by
  fingerprint technology represents     billion and facial
recognition   million of that     billion  currently the biometric
industry is in its early stages of growth but we believe government
initiatives will act as a major catalyst towards global industry growth 
for example on january  th of this year the u  s   visitor and immigrant
status indicator technology was implemented at  airports and  ship
terminals 
requiring u  s  customs officials to digitally photograph and fingerprint
visa carrying foreign nationals data is compared against a government
database of possible terrorists with criminal histories  source  msnbc 
roland jones        the program received   million for the fiscal
year  
biometrics is also used in the battle against occupational fraud  based on
 report findings by the association of certified fraud examiners  acfe 
 the typical organization loses  percent of its annual revenues to
occupational fraud  if multiplied by the u  s  gdp  which in  was just
under   trillion  it would translate into   billion in annual fraud
losses  this is why facekey through its innovative biometric technologies
is focusing much of its core business on fraud  government initiatives are
always plagued with delays due to slow or inconsistent standards of
development  lengthy technology reviews and public comment  to offset that
facekey has diversified into the private sector as well  proving that its
management team has the ability to find other niche areas where its
technology could be used to grow both bottom and top line numbers
continually  in fact in a press release issued january     annette
h  starkweather  facekey corp  coo goes on to say    on a recent trip to
las vegas  we discovered that casinos represent a largely underdeveloped
market that could benefit from facekey  s biometric products  based on
discussions we have had with casino personnel  our multiple face tracking
software engine would greatly improve the speed and efficiency of current
surveillance methods used by many las vegas casinos to screen their crowds
for persons that could pose a security threat  
due to an emerging global market and facekey  s ability to target both
public and private sectors through there innovative facial and fingerprint
recognition technologies we believe this company has the ability increase
market share significantly  i think jp morgan  s analyst paul coster says
it best when he wrote in his september  nd  research report we think
biometrics looks like a rising tide that should lift all boats
