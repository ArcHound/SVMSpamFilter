q 
what
is considered factory refurbished 
a  there are lots of
things that can label items factory refurbished  some are so
frivolous  its laughable  but because consumer laws prevent
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished
as  new   the second consumer gets the best deal  here are a few
examples 
manufacturers 
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory 
country 
to avoid
 disturbing  the dealer  reseller channel in different
countries  manufacturers and distributors cannot export the
product  as new and therefore label it as refurb and reduce the
warranty 
most major retail
superstores offer a   day money back guarantee on their
products and there are those consumers that just simply take
advantage of that  these items are returned to the manufacturer 
inspected and repackaged like new 
items where the
box or casing was damaged in shipment  which are returned to the
manufacturer 
the item was
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect  the
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer  tested
and then repackaged just like new 
the item was
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that
was corrected 
demonstration
units are also considered factory refurbished  these units are
inspected  tested and repackaged 
the box was simply
opened  thats it 
brand new
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished 
all factory
refurbished products are inspected serviced by the
manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product
specifications  all
merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer
unless otherwise specified
