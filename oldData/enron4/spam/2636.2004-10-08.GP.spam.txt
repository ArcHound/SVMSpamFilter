otc pink sheets  tirr today announced the acquisition of a  
working interest in a  well oil field in karnes county  texas  the
south texas field  which has been shut in since the mid  s when
the price of oil declined to less than     per barrel  is
situated on  acres  tradestar will initially focus its efforts in
the nobson field  which has reserves of approximately   
barrels  the company also has options on adjoining acreage with
additional prospects  the recompletion project  anticipated to be
completed and online by mid  november  is expected to yield   
barrels of oil per day 
oct    tradestar corporation  otc pink sheets  tirr  today
announced the acquisition of a producing gas well and disposal well
in erath county  texas  the single well package is currently
producing  thousand cubic feet of natural gas per day and has one
offset drill location that could push daily production to better
than  thousand cubic feet per day  an additional  acres
surrounding the wells are under option as well  the acquisition also
offers barnett shale potential  which tradestar ceo tom feimster
called strategic in light of the company  s current joint venture
with united production and exploration 
with oil and natural gas prices sitting near   year highs  north
american oil gas companies are generating exceptionally strong
financial results  with increased consumption and reliance on
foreign imports driving the price of crude to nearly   per barrel 
the resulting us energy situation is the most serous domestic energy
crisis since the arab oil embargo of the  s  with more than  
of us oil coming from foreign imports  us crude inventories are
likely to remain at low levels given anemic production from
venezuela and nigeria  continuing uncertainty over iraqi wells  and
production caps from opec  on the natural gas front  supply
continues to remain tight to increasing demand  with shrinking
relative us production  these international supply issues are
increasingly driving a renewed trend towards domestic exploration
and production operations  new developments in the petroleum
industry are beginning to play out in terms of discovery of new
reserves and more efficient production of existing reserves  with
the increased use of technologies such as   d seismic making new
exploration more affordable and effective  and with use of secondary
and tertiary recovery processes to recover the more than   of oil
left in  ground with primary production techniques 
tradestar corporation is a rapidly emerging independent oil and gas
company  engaged in the exploration  development  and exploitation
of on  shore oil and natural gas opportunities in proven producing
areas of the united states  including oklahoma  texas  and
louisiana  the company intends to utilize advanced oilfield
surveying and extraction technologies  such as   d seismic  lateral
drilling  and enhanced oil recovery  to identify  acquire  and
exploit bypassed and overlooked reserves which can be rapidly
exploited without significant risk and capital expenditure  the
company is capitalizing on both of the major trends in domestic oil
and gas ep operations  carefully screening and selecting properties
for maximum potential of overlooked and bypassed production
opportunities  and using advanced production technologies to
minimize risks  under the guidance of a management team experienced
in oil and gas exploration and production  tradestar has developed
critical strategic relationships with oil industry partners and is
beginning an aggressive acquisition strategy  targeting a number of
highly promising opportunities throughout the united states  with a
number of major projects in the acquisition pipeline  we believe
that tirr presents a unique chance to invest in the domestic
oil gas boom  aggressive investors looking for above  average
return potential on a portion of their investment capital should
give tirr serious consideration  management of the company  headed
by ceo tom feimster  are highly talented and experienced in the oil
gas industry  and posses a wealth of technical expertise and
knowledge  we believe that tirr has developed a viable and highly
promising acquisition strategy  backed by its commitment to the use
of new oilfield technologies and focus on exploiting proven
producing properties  which should enable the company to rapidly
develop significant revenue streams  investors at current trading
levels may be rewarded over the short term and beyond as tirrs
business plan is executed  tirr is one of the markets best kept
secrets  and we expect investors to give this issue increasing
attention over the coming months 
a few reasons to consider adding tirr to your investment portfolio 
the outlook for oil gas stocks is extremely positive with prices
at historic levels and continued demand stimulating additional
exploration and production efforts among domestic producers  while
it seems unlikely that prices will remain at their current levels 
the long term outlook for both demand and higher prices is
unparalleled in recent history  with current market conditions 
domestic ep companies are experiencing a huge run  up in prices as
they seek to exploit north americas significant oil and natural gas
resource base with new exploration techniques and drilling
technologies  through its dual positioning in high  growth oil and
natural gas markets  we believe that tirr is exceptionally well
situated to benefit from these favorable market conditions and
stands to see significant appreciation of its share price over the
near term period 
with its operations in the exploration and production of natural
gas properties  tirr is ideally positioned at the forefront of a us
natural gas boom  as us demand for natural gas is
increasing  domestic production is becoming strained with many
long  term prime producing areas reaching the point of depletion  by
  us consumption of natural gas  driven by the expansion of
gas  fired electric generation facilities  is expected to reach 
trillion cubic feet from approximately  tcf currently  natural
gas prices on the spot market have nearly doubled from less than 
years ago  and are currently testing the   per million british
thermal units  btu  price threshold  with increases to     levels
likely over the winter months  with us demand exceeding production
of roughly    tcf per year  approximately   of us natural gas
needs are already being imported from canada  with natural gas
impossible to transport across oceans  with the exception of lng 
which represents a small fraction of overall natural gas
consumption   this has created a tremendous future for domestic
ep firms  including tirr 
tradestar is in the process of acquiring a balanced portfolio of
producing oil gas properties onshore in the gulf coast and
oklahoma  which will significantly improve its asset base  revenue 
and earnings outlook over the near term period  tirr has entered
into a letter of intent to acquire two properties in the heavily
producing arkoma basin region of oklahoma  one of the most prolific
natural gas producing areas in north america with estimated reserves
of  tcf  the company has also proposed a jv project in the
dynamic barnett shale natural gas play in central texas  the largest
producing gas field in texas with estimated reserves of more than 
tcf  tirr has additionally acquired a  acre property in karnes
county  texas a mature producing area which can provide new
opportunities due to improvements in drilling technology and
production techniques  with these properties  and additional
planned acquisitions in the onshore gulf coast region  we believe
that tradestar is admirably positioned as a strong junior oil gas
investment 
tirr has developed an innovative business model centered on pursuit
of a balanced development and exploration strategy and portfolio 
and the use of advanced oilfield survey and recovery technologies 
which will significantly improve production efforts at acquired
properties  tradestar seeks to acquire bypassed and overlooked
reserves in proven producing areas  and to develop working interests
in undercapitalized and under  producing projects  tirr intends to
capitalize and maximize on already developed drilling and
exploration projects with lower cost initiatives that have a high
degree of success including infield drilling  drilling of multiple
wells onto an existing leasehold   development of behind  pipe
reserves  development of shallower pay zones above the deepest
productive zone on established wells   secondary and eor recovery
techniques  lateral drilling  and the use of other advanced
completion and production techniques  tradestar also intends to
aggressively pursue acquisition opportunities for higher  risk 
higher reward ep prospects  utilizing advanced data analysis to
reprocess older   d seismic data with   d seismic and correlating
this seismic  gravity  geochemical and geologic data with existing
well logs to significantly mitigate the expense and risk
traditionally associated with new ep projects
