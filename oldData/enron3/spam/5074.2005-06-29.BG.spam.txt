order to foster the growth of plantations that provide timber for
construction  furniture building  wood pulp  and other products 
the tree grows well in a variety of climactic conditions  and the
plantlets contain no contaminants and are subject to no known
import  export restrictions  therefore  the marketability ofthis
product is extremely high 
the global cedar treeis the result of 
years of research and genetic technology development  it
is the fastest growing hardwood tree on the planet  capable of
achieving growth levels of    feet in its first year alone 
after just the first year  the tree can be harvested and will
re  grow from the stump  providing multiple harvests for years  the
timber produced is excellent for fine furniture and other uses for
which the wood of fast growing soft woods is unsuitable  the
potential benefits of the tree are legion  from positive effects
on the ozone and a buffer against rainforest depletion  as world
demand for wood products continues to outpace world supply
