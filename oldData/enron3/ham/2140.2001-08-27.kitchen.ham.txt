subject  mhi  f  s sale process  status
brett 
the following is a status summary on where we are regarding the sale of the first  mhi  f turbines 
our two most firm candidates right now are 
 i  fred lange  from rescue   for a project in california of a company called intercom  his offer for the turbines  the already directed change orders and spare parts was us        he agreed to make a us     payment for a three  week exclusivity upon execution of the relevant ppa  which is expected for today  the ppa execution was postponed for a week  from last monday until today  due to regulatory changes in california  therefore  there is no certainty about the ppa being executed today  we will talk to fred lange tomorrow to check where the process is 
 ii  rick davis  from genassis  for a project in mexico  of a company called empresa industrial rio colorado  his offer for the turbines  the already directed change orders and spare parts was us        he made his offer willing to make a us   million exclusivity payment  to be refundable  if enron does not obtain the assignment of the mhi contract   we will call him tomorrow to inform him it is really up to them to qualify as a permitted assignee  they have a copy of the contract with the permitted assignee conditions   and will check his position about making the us   million payment absolutely non  refundable 
as a back up  we are also talking to a couple of other brokers  mike edwards  belyea power  and tom young  try ventures    who are running behind the two above mentioned
