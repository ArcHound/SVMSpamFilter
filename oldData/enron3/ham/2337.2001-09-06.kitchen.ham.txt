executive summary
assembly  s mou supporters  mia   vote stalled
bailout hang  ups  land  bonds  and referendum
socal up for grabs 
mou support waning
as of last night  assemblyman hertzberg reportedly had  votes in favor of the bailout that he could  count on   there were  more votes that were  close  and stood a  reasonable chance  of being cast in favor of the bailout  however  that still left hertzberg  votes short of the  he needs  earlier today  sen  polanco  the bill  s sponsor  privately indicated that the few remaining votes necessary to pass the amended sb  xx were in place due to lobbying efforts by gov  davis  no doubt the count will be close  but hertzberg will only take the bill up in the assembly for a vote today or tomorrow if he knows democrats can muster enough support 
the key issues related to getting the  votes to pass sb  xx are the following 
including the option to buy the transmission lines  for some this is a philosophical issue  these members are quite adamant that the option to buy the lines needs to be removed from sb  xx 
excess profits and creditworthiness  in particular how edison can use any profits 
the philosophy underlying the bill itself as to whether a bailout is necessary given the experience with pg if the language comes out of the bill  the plan will no longer be acceptable to socal 
socal  selling out or going under
there is word in sacramento of companies  sniffing around  for a pre  packaged purchase of edison after the bankruptcy occurs  we will continue to investigate possible buyers and report when information becomes available 
it is also rumored that if an  inadequate  bill passes  i  e   one that will not return socal to creditworthiness  socal may declare voluntary bankruptcy  then use whatever bailout is passed as a revenue stream in bankruptcy  the only requirement laid upon socal is to attempt to go back into the market by january   and there is no penalty for them failing to do so  there appears to be nothing in the bailout bill that would preclude them from using money from the bailout in bankruptcy
