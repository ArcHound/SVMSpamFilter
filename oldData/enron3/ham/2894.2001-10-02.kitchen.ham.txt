lower  profile women topple more well  known names from tech and
internet sector  ranking includes  newcomers
though hewlett  packard lost   billion in market value in a year  ceo carly fiorina hasn  t lost her nerve  and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no   position on fortune  s ranking of the  most powerful women in business 
the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october  issue of fortune  available on newsstands october  and at www  fortune  com at    p  m  on october  
in the no   spot is ebay ceo meg whitman  who runs an internet company that actually makes money    million in the last four quarters on   million in revenue  oprah winfrey  the queen of media  is mightier than ever  and holds the no   spot  up from no   last year  she produces movies  brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers  propels books to bestsellerdom  and  last year  teamed up with hearst magazines  cathie black  no   on the list  to publish o  the oprah magazine  by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever  at no   is andrea jung  chairman and ceo of avon  who has breathed life into ailing avon  mirant ceo marce fuller  the only newcomer in the top five  holds the no   position  inside a stodgy utility  southern  fuller built a high  growth trading and marketing unit  which was spun off in april 
in these new  more tempered times  patience may be about to reap its reward  in fortune  s annual survey of the  most powerful women in business  there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly  says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in  patient but not passive   the story that accompanies the list   by patience  we mean staying with a company  steadily building influence there  and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge  not promises and self  promotion  
fiorina  who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune  s inaugural list in   heads the biggest company    billion in revenues last year  run by a woman  and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever  wall street practically heckled her latest move  a bold bet to buy compaq  but fiorina    remains defiant  in difficult times   people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny   she says 
as always  the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time  last year  power resided in the technology and internet sectors  but that influence was fleeting  gone from the list this year  deborah  hurricane debby  hopkins  who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may  ellen hancock  who failed at the startup  exodus  and morgan stanley  s mary meeker  who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz  but one web warrior looks better than ever  meg whitman  no   on the list  she has never overpromised to investors  instead she has diligently delivered above  target profits every single quarter 
fourteen newcomers join the list this year  marce fuller  president louise kitchen  coo  enron americas  colleen barrett  president betsy bernard  president  ceo  at anne stevens  vp  north america vehicle operations  ford motor  maria elena lagomasino  chairman susan desmond  hellman  evp and chief medical officer  genentech  janet robinson  svp  newspaper operations  new york times co   carol tomi  evp and cfo  home depot  carrie cox  evp and president  global prescriptions  pharmacia  carole black  president and ceo  lifetime television networks  janet davidson  group president  integrated network solutions  lucent  larree renda  evp  retail operations  safeway  and louise francesconi  vp and gm  missile systems  raytheon 
while the economy and its points of power change  the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same  says sellers   we consider the size and importance of a woman  s business in the global economy  her clout inside her company  and the arc of her career  where she has been and where she is likely to go  when appropriate  we also weigh the woman  s influence on mass culture and society  that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no   on this year  s list   the shifts on our list this year are dramatic  with  newcomers  but one trend is especially intriguing  women are taking on bigger businesses than ever  a few years ago  responsibility for a   billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list  no more  this year  s fortune  includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of   billion or more  which is a first 
in a related story   it took a lady to save avon   katrina brooker looks at andrea jung  chairman and ceo of avon  says brooker   jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them  and that  s what has made her one of the most successful ceos  male or female  in recent years   over the past  months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business  how it advertises  manufactures  packages  and even sells its products  and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady  but by reviving her  the result  growth in revenues  operating profits  and operating margins 
in addition  fortune includes an international list of the  powerful women in business  the top ten  featured in the magazine  are marjorie scardino  ceo  pearson  britain   anne lauvergeon  chairman  areva  france   mary ma  senior vp marianne nivert  president lien siaou  sze  vice president  hewlett  packard  hong kong   patricia barbizet  ceo  artemis  france   eiko kono  president  recruit  japan   belinda stronach  ceo  magna international  canada   marina berlusconi  vice chairman  fininvest  italy   christine tsung  president  ceo  china airlines  taiwan   you can read about the other forty at www  fortune  com or in the international editions of fortune
