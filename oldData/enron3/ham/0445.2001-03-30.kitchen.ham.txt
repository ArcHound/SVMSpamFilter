i need to know two things     have the carrying costs been expensed through jan   and    is there commercial value to the turbine  if there is value to the turbine  then i really don  t understand allocating costs to a business unit that doesn  t own the turbine in order to create the illusion of a profitable transaction  i also need to know on what basis and against what agreement calme agreed to bear the carrying costs  the project it supposedly related to has been dead for several years

subject  an allocated turbine
i think i have found the turbine causing the accounting issues  it  s the westinghouse  d  a  the good news is  is that this from a commercial point of view is being looked after so there are no external issues to worry about  just allocation issues 
i would propose that we notify the accountants of the following  
ena to assume the nominal cost of the turbine as of jan      exclusive of carrying costs up to that date  from jan  forward ena will assume full responsibility for any carrying costs  and any continuing payment obligations under the purchase contract with westinghouse 
the nominal cost of the turbine as of jan     exclusive of carrying costs  is        this is the amount that we propose ena to assume with respect to the turbine 
the carrying cost through jan  to be assumed by calme  ega is        this amount reflects the actual carrying charges imposed by enron corp on calme  ega based upon the payments made to westinghouse under the purchase agreement 
the continuing payment obligation to be assumed by ena under the purchase contract with westinghouse is        this amount reflects the actual final payment due under the contract  which is due at commercial operations 
i think that does it and should clear up the accounting issues and wes can then deal with sorting out the allocations 
 wes please sort out unless jim has any problems with the above methodology  
thanks
