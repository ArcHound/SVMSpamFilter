Subject california update      p  
details are still rough and the situation is very fluid  but here is what is currently going on 
senators hertzberg and keeley are amending both sb  xx and ab  xx  upon an initial read  it appears that they are doing the following 
ab  xx has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the renewables portfolio   the core  non  core business provisions  the transmission asset purchase  etc  all appear to have been deleted   both of these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debated 
it appears amendments have been made to sb  xx but the extent of these changes are not yet known 
at the beginning of both amended bills  it states   as proposed to be amended into sb  xx   this means that amendments to sb  could be incorporated into ab   and vice versa  another possibility is an entirely new bill
