these are my weekly update reports which highlight what each group has been doing this week  keeps me in the loop  i would like them to add a breakdown of their income booked  ytd  as it doesn  t always tie to what appears on the financials 
i will attach calger  s  nothing difficult  but no doubt they are trying to find out what numbers are actually showing up next to their names so they can explain it  therefore in the exmaple below chris says he has mads     m this year  does that tie to the number on our earnings report  i didn  t ask for forecasts as chris has below  just an explanation of their p  l so far this year 
this is just a simple note which they need to add to their weekly updates  shouldn  t involve you guys  unless of course the numbers don  t tie  so i think that  s why you had phone calls

we are receiving questions about your request  there is some confusion about what you want  is it that the teams need to be broken down differently  is it a weekly thing as opposed to monthly  each commercial team has a coordinator for p  l reporting and they prepare acctg reports as requested on behalf of the commercial lead  they will revise as you wish  we just need to know how you would like to change what you are getting  by the way  don  t forget that there is somewhat detailed reporting of p  l in the monthly team report with detail of margin as well as expense breakdown into  types from comp and benefits to rent  depreciation  t dawson  brian

could you all add to your weekly reports a p  l statement breaking down your income to date this year  it is difficult to actually break down the numbers in the weekly p  l sheets delivered by wes  s group  a break down on your weekly reports would be great 
please could you email all weekly reports to tammie schoppe on a friday  and copy me  and tammie will distribute to john  i have spent some time this week bringing john up to speed on everybody  s areas and what you each have going on 
tammie has all of my contact numbers and will be in contact with me  i am sure i will be back in contact in the next few weeks and i will be picking up email after i initially come to terms with the lack of sleep etc 
take care
louise
