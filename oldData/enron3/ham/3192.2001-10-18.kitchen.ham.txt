enron corp  shrank its shareholder equity by     billion as the company decided to repurchase  million of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer andrew s  fastow 
enron didn  t disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on tuesday  when the houston  based energy giant announced a     billion charge to third  quarter earnings that produced a   million loss  but the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday  as a result of the reduction  enron  s shareholder equity has dropped to     billion  the company said 
in an interview tuesday  enron chairman kenneth lay said that about   million of the     billion charge to earnings was related to transactions with ljm  co  investment lp  a limited partnership created and run by mr  fastow  in a conference call yesterday with investors  mr  lay said that the  million shares had been repurchased by enron  as the company  unwound  its participation in the transactions  in the third quarter  the company  s average number of shares outstanding was  million 
according to rick causey  enron  s chief accounting officer  these shares were contributed to a  structured finance vehicle  set up about two years ago in which enron and ljm  were the only investors  in exchange for the stock  the entity provided enron with a note  the aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of enron  s broadband telecommunications and other technology investments  mr  causey didn  t elaborate on what form those hedges took 
subsequently  both the value of enron  s stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply  as a result  enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares  when enron reacquired the shares  it also canceled the note it had received from the entity 
in addition  enron was receiving increasing criticism from analysts and major shareholders concerning the apparent conflict of interest involving the role of its chief financial officer in the partnership  from which he stood to make millions of dollars  in july  mr  fastow formally severed his connections to ljm  mr  fastow has declined to be interviewed 
given all the complexities of the ljm  related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company   the confusion factor wasn  t worth the trouble of trying to continue this   mr  causey said 
enron downplayed the significance of the share  reduction exercise  mark palmer  an enron spokesman  described it  as just a balance  sheet issue  and therefore wasn  t deemed  material  for disclosure purposes 
jeff dietret  an analyst for simmons  co  in houston  said that a large reduction of equity could be  a flag for the rating agencies  because it could adversely affect a company  s debt  to  equity ratio  enron said yesterday that as a result of the equity reduction  its debt  to  equity ratio rose to   from   previously 
on tuesday  after enron reported its big quarterly loss  moody  s investors service inc  put enron  s long  term debt on review for a possible downgrade  moody  s said the move was related to  significant write  downs and charges reflecting substantially reduced valuations  in several of enron  s businesses  in recent years  enron had moved aggressively into broadband telecommunications and the water business  both of which failed to produce expected returns 
enron  which as of june  had     billion in current liabilities and long  term debt  has lately been attempting to shed assets to pay down debt

enron corp   s board cost the company at least   million by allowing the chief financial officer to manage partnerships that bought enron assets  a shareholder alleges 
fred greenberg filed the suit wednesday in harris county district court  said his lawyer  paul paradis 
chief financial officer andrew fastow  s positions with two limited partnerships that bought enron assets were a clear conflict of interest  paradis said  the lawsuit doesn  t specify which assets the partnerships bought

 adds detail on third  quarter loss in final paragraph  
houston  oct    bloomberg    enron corp   s board cost the
company at least   million by allowing the chief financial
officer to manage partnerships that bought enron assets  a
shareholder alleges in a lawsuit 
shareholder fred greenberg filed the suit today in harris
county district court in houston  said paul paradis  a partner at
the law firm abbey gardy llp and greenberg  s attorney  enron is
based in houston 
chief financial officer andrew fastow  s positions with two
limited partnerships that bought enron assets was a clear conflict
of interest  paradis said  the lawsuit doesn  t specify which
assets the partnerships bought 
  enron directors permitted fastow to be in the unique
position of knowing what assets were worth    paradis said    he
was placed in the position of irreconcilable conflict that
permitted him to capitalize on enron  s proprietary information   
the lawsuit comes the day after enron reported     billion
in third  quarter losses from failed investments  the wall street
journal reported today that   million of the losses were
connected with two limited partnerships run by fastow 
the suit seeks damages of at least   million  paradis said 
damages would be paid to the company  probably by insurance
protecting directors from lawsuits  paradis said 
enron spokesman mark palmer declined to comment on the
allegations 
formed to lower debt
the company has formed several limited partnerships that buy
its assets  this allows enron to reduce debt so it can borrow more
money for other projects 
the suit  citing details from today  s wall street journal
article  says fastow ran two of the partnerships  ljm cayman and
ljm   he could have earned as much as  percent annually of the
total amounts the partnerships invested  the suit says  ljm cayman
raised   million in initial partnership capital  while ljm 
raised at least   million 
allowing a company official to run the partnerships raises
the question of impropriety  said andre meade  an analyst at
commerzbank securities who rates enron a   buy   and owns no
company shares 
partnerships not uncommon
many companies create limited partnerships  meade said  using
them for tax purposes    duke energy corp  and kinder morgan inc 
both have limited partnerships where assets are transferred    he
said 
enron also has owned a controlling interest in whitewing
limited partnership  whitewing was financed with a     billion
bond sale last year conducted by osprey trust  which set up the
partnership with   million for buying enron assets  according
to the osprey trust offering memorandum 
whitewing has bought  enron power and gas companies since
it was formed in   according to the memorandum  it had sold
four of them as of september   enron said in the offering
memorandum that officers and directors of the energy trader may
serve as directors of whitewing 
  therefore the duties of the directors and officers of enron
may conflict with the duties of the officers and directors of
whitewing management llc    the osprey trust offering memorandum
says 
enron reported a third  quarter loss of   million  or 
cents a share yesterday  compared with net income of   million 
or  cents  a year earlier  shares of enron fell     to

enron  the us energy trader which is under intense scrutiny by analysts who have demanded the company release more detailed financial information  on wednesday gave details of a     bn charge against equity it skipped over in its third quarter results briefing on tuesday 
on wednesday  enron outlined details of a     bn charge against earnings in its result  due to failed investments in its telecommunications  retail energy sales and water businesses 
ken lay  chairman  fleetingly mentioned a separate     bn charge against equity  or a dilution of equity on the company  s balance sheet  in a conference call with analysts and the media  and said it would not affect the company  s credit rating 
many analysts apparently thought this was the     bn charge mr lay was willing to break down and to answer questions about 
mr lay met analysts on wednesday in new york  but there was again no mention of the     bn charge  mr lay apparently initially refused to answer questions from frustrated analysts  in august  after the departure of enron  s chief financial officer  jeff skilling  mr lay promised to provide more earnings transparency 
 it was unbelievable  questions were asked and he moved around it and then finally he  mr lay  gave a roundabout answer  the      bn  charge was all related to the writing down of the se failed investments   one analyst said 
 they were trying to sneak it by  they already have a credibility problem and this did not help it   he said  adding that enron never disclosed the charge  s net effect and moody  s inv estor  s services  the credit rating agency  placed enron  s   bn of debt on hold minutes later   we told them we felt they should have been more honest in the presentation  yesterday   
enron rejected criticism of the failure to fully report and explain the     bn charge

 c  reuters limited  
london  oct   reuters   the london metal exchange  lme  faces stormy times a year after demutualisation as members ask where their future lies  with electronic screens  on an open  outcry trading floor or even in some other type of business 
the debate is happening as the global metals industry gathers in london for the lme  s annual dinner week  which this year will be a subdued affair 
 lme week will struggle to surprise against a backcloth of military action in afghanistan  dismal economic data  forlorn price sentiment and optimists rarer than hen  s teeth   analyst nick moore of j  p  morgan securities said 
a veteran trader said   it is going to be a less  populous affair this year  the people that have to do their annual deals will still be there  but we have noticed that people are not travelling unless they have to  
the downturn in the economic cycle has hit the world  s largest non  ferrous metals market hard  years of volume growth have ended  prices have fallen to lows and shrinking revenues and commissions have pared many brokers  profits 
mitsuibussan has scaled back activities and no longer makes markets  scotiamocatta has left the floor and blue  blooded n  m  rothschild has simply quit the non  ferrous metals business 
the way to trade
lme trading remains dominated by the price discovery mechanism of the open  outcry official rings  but electronic systems have made deep inroads over the past year 
 the trade is rapidly being condensed into the three screen mediums  enron  spectron and lme select   a director at one broker said 
traders said screens had almostly completely superseded the telephone market during inter  office sessions as narrower buy  sell quotes in larger markets were available on the highly transparent screens 
 what that has done is to perfect the pricing mechanism  it has flattened out some of the volatility from the market  this has cut the brokers  margins  but at the same time their overheads are constant  they have to pay for screens and to run a floor operation   the director said 
screen trading volumes still represent only a small proportion of total daily turnover  but earlier this week the lme reported a record daily turnover of    lots on the select system  by far the highest since the screens were switched on in february 
 we are working hard to ensure that lme select becomes the electronic trading system of choice for our members   lme chief executive simon heale said 
however  senior traders said that once volumes started to increase on screens  electronic turnovers could explode  as had happened on other exchanges  that could force the issue for the lme as it continued to offer three methods of trading  screens  telephones and open  outcry 
 despite the lme  s resistance  the world is turning to screens  the ipe  international petroleum exchange  is going that way  and in the u  s  that pattern is being seen as well   another senior trader said 
incentives
traders said open  outcry trading would wither away unless the lme acted to make it more attractive to existing participants and potential new entrants 
 they should be thinking about giving discounts to people on the ring  maybe they should also approach some of the big off  market players and find out what would entice them to become rdms  ring dealing members    the veteran trader said 
in europe  other than the lme only the ipe has an open  outcry floor  and that will close next year 
the rdms of the lme are trying to fight back  in  they extended the open  outcry sessions by carrying on business through an early  afternoon recess 
but after scotiamocatta metals decided to call a halt to executing business on the floor this week rdm numbers have dwindled to just  
 it is a structural problem as there is just not enough income on the ring  we are almost getting to a  last man standing  situation  if we drop under  there is a danger the ring may just implode   the senior trader said 
the ranks of associate broker clearer members  abcms  are expanding  these firms have all the benefits of lme membership  but cannot trade during the open  outcry sessions 
this week  south africa  s investec group joined as an abcm  bringing the total of this membership tier to   another sizeable bank is pondering whether to join  but only as an abcm 
 it would be good if someone else came down  but who is going to spend money recruiting a team  clerks  support staff  back office and so on  it is best to go for a small team using screens  the lme needs to either cut our costs or make it less easy to go off  market   a senior floor trader said

the maharashtra government has decided to challenge the injunction order issued by the commercial court in london restraining the state from filing suits against the dabhol power company  dpc  in india  the dpc had obtained the injunction on octoberl  
the state government has decided to challenge the order as we feel that the concerned court should have heard the state as well  within a week we would be presenting our case  the state chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said here on wednesday 
the ex  parte order relates to arbitration proceedings between the state government and dpc with respect to state guarantee  state support and supplemental state support agreements 
it prevented the state government from taking any legal action in india  challenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by dpc  mr deshmukh today also reiterated his governments resolve not to draw electricity from dpc 
there is no logic in buying dpc power at higher rate and selling it with much lower rates  deshmukh said  according to deshmukh  due to recent rainfall  the demand for electricity has gone down considerably and the state electricity board is supplying power without interruption 
meanwhile  the government today expressed its resolve to initiate a judicial probe into the entire enron deal  the probe would begin in few weeks  deshmukh said  the state has already requested the chief justice of the mumbai high court to appoint a judge for the probe

the arbitration panel has been constituted for some time now and proceedings were expected to begin any time  however  the proceedings could not take off as a dispute over the jurisdiction of the maharashtra state electricity regulatory commission had dragged on to the mumbai high court and then the supreme court  both the courts had restrained dpc from continuing international arbitration pending resolution of the merc jurisdiction issue 
the chief minister also said the appointment of a retired supreme court judge to head the judicial probe into the power purchase agreement with enron would also be completed in a week  s time

new delhi  oct   gas authority of india ltd  gail  has written to both the petroleum ministry and the power ministry evincing interest in the  million tonnes per annum  mmtpa  lng regassification terminal of the dabhol power company  according to government officials 
in a recent communique to the two ministries  it has asked the financial institutions to set up a meeting to enable it review the financial details of the lng project  the financial data on the lng project solely rests with bechtel  ge and enron 
as a first step towards examining the financial data  gail will require to enter into a confidentiality clause agreement with the present project sponsors to access the data 
meanwhile  the financial institutions are awaiting the results of political parleys between the centre and the maharashtra government towards bringing the latter into a  solution finding  mode to implement a financial restructuring package and resolve the dabhol crisis 
once this is done  the fis will freeze the financial package  involving sacrifices undertaken by the present stakeholders  and again elicit market response towards bettering the tatas  proposition 
although the fis had earlier scouted the market and found only the tatas evincing interest in the project  it would again offer the dabhol project to the market to ensure that the concessions on the part of the state are not awarded on a nomination basis 
the foreign lenders have pointed out that they would not be agreeable to the domestic fis spearheading the salvage operation finally resulting in transfer of ownership of the power plant  hence  the government is mulling a high  level committee to implement the process leading to transfer of ownership
