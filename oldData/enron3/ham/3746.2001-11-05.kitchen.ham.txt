rudwell  as you can probably imagine  we have had several counterparties with whom enovate has pending transactions that have initially claimed they will not accept enron  s credit as part of the transaction  below is a list of those counterparties to date 
counterparty service term total value
wisconsin gas  day storage service  yrs                   
wisconsin gas  day storage service  yrs                   
wisconsin pub  svc  day storage service  months                 
txu storage service  yr                 
we are also in the process of negotiating transactions with several other counterparties including oneok  pg  e  and pancanadian  they have not yet raised credit concerns 
it is obviously imperative that we keep business moving forward  in that regard  what has our response been to such denials of credit  have we thought about posting l  c  s or is that cost prohibitive  we may have some flexibility with peoples posting credit  but that has certain legal implications and is limited  also  three of the above deals do not start until april so we may have some flexibility with timing  however  all of the above counterparties are anxious to put the contracting logistics behind them in case the deals fall through and they need to replace the service 
any thoughts and assistance on this effort is greatly appreciated
