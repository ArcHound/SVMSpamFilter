in additon to the      property value for bammel lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for bammel gas storage of       requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with aep not enron and thus the  plan premium allocations of     on the bammel gas storage      value and     on the bammel lease value of      should not be needed 
jackie
please remove these amounts from the ena  hpl  plan

as discussed for the purposes of the  insurance budget  we will delete the bammel lease    property values of        we will advise the insurers effective this past june to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund  however  as respects asset divestitures  insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience  however  if we are successful in receiving a credit  we will refund the premium 
i will discuss with karen and brian the other remaining assets 
regards
