Subject ferc  s prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for ca wholesale
electric markets
the following report is comprised of what was discussed at the commission meeting held tonight at approximately  pm est and additional intelligence gathered from ferc staffers after the meeting by joe hartsoe 
physical withholding   to prevent physical withholding  the plan will require sellers with pga  s to offer all their available power in real time  all california generators  even those not subject to ferc price regulation  will be required to sell into the iso  s real time market as a condition of their use of the iso  s interstate transmission lines  hydroelectric facilities will be exempted      for lyr 
price mitigation  the plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market  during stage    and  emergencies in the iso  s real time market  each generator  other than hydro  with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator  s heat curve  emission rates  gas costs and emission costs  plus   for o emissions are to be based on cammon fitzgerald     the gas cost and emissions will be published the day after  for use on the following day  a single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators  highest bid sets the clearing price  each gas fired generator must file with ferc and the iso  on a confidential basis  heat and emission rates for each generating unit  the iso will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator  including maintenance and operating costs  in the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price  the generator must  within  days of the end of each month  file a report with ferc and the iso justifying its price  ferc has  days to review  act  no opportunity costs in real time  marketers are in the same boat  as they must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost  however  credit sleeves are permissible 
demand response  beginning june   only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids  ferc is attempting to break the demand curve      
outages   pga generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages in accordance with the commission staff proposal adopted by ferc 
term  order expires one year from date of issuance 
rto filing  california iso and two utilities must make rto filing by june  or order lapses with no further effect 
iso reporting  on september     iso must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built  comments are due in  days  quarterly reports thereafter 
revocation of market based rate authority and refunds  the market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on   no physical withhold of capacity  and   no inappropriate bidding behavior  inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior  an increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate  in addition   hockey stick  bids are expressly prohibited  i  e  bidding   at marginal cost and   at a much higher level  
limited  filing  applies to sales in the wscc  outside california  refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below    control areas are not required to publish when this condition occurs  apparently anything over marginal cost must be justified  all marketers and non  hydroelectric generators must offer to sell contractually and physically available capacity  energy to a location within wscc  ferc is attempting to mirror the rules applied in california  comments are due in  days on the  investigations  the refund effective date is  days from publication of the order 
nox limits in california   must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law  however  it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement  just include the fines as part of the price bid  also if nox is limited  may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price 
surcharge to pay past amount due   comments are due in  days on   whether ferc should require the iso to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and   the effect this surcharge would have on the pg  e bankruptcy filing 
no mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from california  the order is not finally drafted as of yet  and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the final order  we will keep you posted
