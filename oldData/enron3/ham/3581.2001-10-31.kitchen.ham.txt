subject  edf mann initial margin
importance  high
per the broker statement received this morning the initial margin for mann increased by only     mm  it does not appear that they have changed their margin calculation method from this  i have contacted the enron person responsible for confirming the amounts to be settled with mann and instructed her to contact me if mann requests any settlement that differs from the statement received this morning  the preliminary number for mann  s initial margin and variation margin was a net inflow of     mm 
i will let you know of any changes  thanks
