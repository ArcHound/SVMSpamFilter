subject  hanover gkh merger idea
the following is a quick review of the gkh merger analysis and the reasons we do not support it  it is also important to keep in mind that gkh is motivated to create a short  term exit from hanover due to the exigencies of their investment partnership expiration  klein  s agenda is transparent 
  while hanover is a well  managed  growth company  it is not a  turnaround  or  special opportunity  situation for which application of enron  s business model would promise the extraordinary returns required in order to justify an investment of   billion 
  as enron  s stock price has declined  the attractiveness of using it as a currency in any acquisition has decreased  the pe decline also tends to make stock deals more dilutive to enron 
  the gkh analysis asserts   million in initial year synergies and cost savings  however  these benefits are largely predicated upon  a  use of the enron nol  which is an asset enron already owns and can be applied to earnings from any acquisition      million and  b  speculative economies of scale  i  e  higher revenues and margins and significant sg  a reductions     million 
the remaining   million of cited benefits relates to a proposed decapitalization of hanover from a proposed transfer of assets to a non  recourse trust  although credit enhancement and operational guarantees would be required   achieving these benefits would require obtaining the best possible outcome on a number of accounting  financial and credit issues  however  even if all of these issues were resolved  the economic result is insufficient to justify the transaction  the gkh analysis does not consider transaction  transition or capital costs 
  after taking into account the capital expenditures required for hanover to achieve its aggressive growth targets  the company appears to be at best cash flow neutral or slightly cash flow negative for the three years presented in the gkh analysis  even including all claimed synergies and cost savings  
  enron and hanover could achieve and share many of the synergistic benefits claimed for the merger in a properly structured joint venture   however  this would still require finding an internal enron  sponsor  to assume ownership of the relationship  
  much of hanover  s growth in the future is predicated upon an aggressive expansion and expenditure program internationally  given enron  s domestic opportunities  this international orientation in a non  core business is inconsistent with our present strategy 
  like gkh  enron has been a seller of our hanover position  an abrupt reversal of strategies could create significant uncertainties and confusion on the street about enron  s strategic direction 
additional background to demonstrate the magnitude of the limitations of the gkh analysis with respect to increasing enron  s eps 
  if pooling of interest accounting is available  any acquisition enron makes of any company that has a lower pe ratio than enron is accretive to enron  s eps  there is nothing  remarkable  about this  it is simple mathematics 
  if purchase accounting is required  even if the entire purchase price were accounted as  goodwill  and never amortized  this would only replicate the results of pooling of interest  however  in actuality  a significant proportion of the purchase price would have to be allocated to assets  tangible and intangible such as contracts  which would produce additional depreciation and amortization expense not mentioned in the gkh analysis 
  the largest single  synergy  by far in the gkh analysis is usage of enron  s nol to shield hanover  s taxable earnings  enron can obtain the benefit of its nol by acquiring any profitable company  gm recorded about     billion in income tax expense last year which would offer even greater opportunity to utilitize this enron asset 
  the gkh analysis is totally silent with respect to the biggest single immediate risk of a transaction  i  e  the potential negative impact on enron  s own pe
