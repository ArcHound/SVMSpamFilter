here  s a little issue 
we have recently needed some screens  pcs etc for new starters  obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving  my understanding from don black  who is hiring these people  is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get it to give us a temporary  old screens from egm  until we move  what is happening behind the scenes on this issue  do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent 
thanks
louise
