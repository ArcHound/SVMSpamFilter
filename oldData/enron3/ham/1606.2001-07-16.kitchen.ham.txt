good morning 
attached  please find the latest issue of our independent power weekly 
 
summary 
  ipps fall     last week our ipp composite fell      underperforming
both the nasdaq        and the s    the ferc settlement conference
adjourned on july   on july   the presiding alj issued a recommendation
favorable to generators     on july   the us bankruptcy court approved
calpine  s settlement with pg and     on july   nrg energy announced it
would acquire a    mw portfolio from indeck 
  latin america pressuring aes earnings the likelihood of downside to our
 eps estimate for aes  corp  of     has increased materially  we
believe the ongoing currency weakness combined with power rationing have the
potential to negatively impact  eps by          versus prior
expectations  on a stand  alone basis  while management indicated in mid  may
that it could offset weakness in brazil  the currency has materially
depreciated since that time and shows no signs of improvement in the
near  term  aes  s second quarter earnings conference call will take place on
july   following the call  we will adjust our  estimate accordingly 
unless management indicates that it remains positioned to offset these items
through upside in other parts of its business 
  ferc alj issues report on thursday       curtis wagner  the
administrative law judge who presided over the recent settlement conference 
issued a report presenting his findings and recommendations for next steps 
overall  the report was very much consistent with our expectations  while
wagner notes that some refunds are due from the generators  he argues that
the     billion demanded by the state of california  cannot be
substantiated   we believe calpine and mirant offer the greatest downside
protection from this issue
