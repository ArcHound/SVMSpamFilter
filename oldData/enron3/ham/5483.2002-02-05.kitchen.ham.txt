Subject re  ecc new grads
issue is headcount approval  in the next  months i  m not sure we can commit to any increase  although if we get a flying start in canada it is possible  while i think we can explore whether ubs are interested elsewhere  my feeling is that we can  t commit to anything at this stage  if things are different in july them maybe we can reconsider if they haven  t found something elsewhere

subject  ecc new grads
david  we made offers to  new grads a few months ago to work for enron canada corp  ecc is obviously going to renege on these offers  is there any opportunity to have these offers assigned to ubs warburg energy  all four of these new grads are outstanding and the timing should be aligned with business ramping up  ie june  sept timeframe   the estate would be cooperative with assigning the offers and the students are looking for clarity  comfort
