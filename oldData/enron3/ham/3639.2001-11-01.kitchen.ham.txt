los angeles   dow jones   enron corp   s  ene  disclosure of a formal inquiry into partnerships with its former chief financial officer left some wall street analysts concerned thursday that the probe could spill over into the company  s core business  placing further pressure on the company  s stock 
other analysts said they doubted the investigation by the u  s  securities and exchange commission would spread  but added that the uncertainty was weighing on enron  s share price 
 it  s a huge cloud of uncertainty   said merrill lynch analyst steve fleishman  who wouldn  t speculate about the breadth of the investigation 
enron said late wednesday that the sec has elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into  certain of the matters that were the subject of recent press reports   the sec  as a matter of policy  declined to comment on the status or scope of any inquiry 
enron spokeswoman karen denne said it was her understanding that the formal investigation  like the informal inquiry  would be limited to the partnerships  enron is fully cooperating with the sec  she said 
robert christensen  an analyst with fac equities in new york  said he is concerned the sec could use its subpoena power to start probing enron  s natural gas and trading practices 
 i  m hoping that it  s localized to the partnership with andy fastow and deals truly with the partnership as opposed to wandering into the basic interest of enron  which is wholesale trading   christensen said 
enron and its former chief financial officer  andrew fastow  set up complicated vehicles to invest in and hedge enron assets  last month  enron disclosed a     billion writedown of shareholder equity in the third quarter related to transactions it had carried out with those entities  setting off a   drop in the value of the company  s stock in the past two weeks 
investors are already pricing in the possibility the sec investigation will reveal more bad news  christensen said 
 if it is limited to the partnership activities  which caused     billion to evaporate on the equity line  that would be well received   he said   i think the stock price now is reflecting the concerns that there is something greater behind the wood pile of all these partnerships  
thursday afternoon  enron  s shares were down      or    at    the shares have lost two  thirds of their value over the past two weeks  gary hoves  an analyst with argus research in new york  said enron  s shares will continue to trade lower on news of the sec inquiry 
 this is a serious situation  especially since the investigation moved from forth worth to washington d  c    hoves said   it  s hard to say  but my guess is this will be an open  book investigation and they will go into a whole lot of stuff beyond the partnership

new york  nov   reuters   standard  poor  s on thursday cut its long  and short  term ratings for embattled energy trader enron corp   and warned it may cut the ratings again because of  uncertainties  surrounding the company and the possibility of further problems in the capital markets 
enron has said it faces a probe by the securities and exchange commission

downgrades could make it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day  to  day business as fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral  if the ratings fall to junk  enron could be forced to issue more shares 
enron shares closed thursday on the new york stock exchange at      down      or    percent  they have fallen  percent since october   and hit a nine  year low on tuesday

new york   dow jones   competing online energy marketplaces may see some gains as enron corp   ene  struggles with concerns about its credit 
but energy analysts and traders say the houston  based giant  s problems aren  t yet serious enough to outweigh the liquidity it provides and expect its internet  based trading system enrononline to retain its leading position in the electricity and natural gas markets

usa  update   enron  s   billion credit line a mixed blessing 
by janet mcgurty
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
new york  nov   reuters   enron corp  on thursday said it gained   billion in secured credit lines to help support day  to  day trading operations and bolster investor confidence in the beleaguered energy trading giant 
but analysts said the credit is a mixed blessing for the former wall street high flyer now facing a full  scale probe by u  s  regulators into questionable financial dealings  almost daily revelations have rocked enron in the past two weeks and sent its stock price plummeting more than  percent 
 ultimate outcome and underlying fundamentals aside  we believe significant pressure and uncertainty will remain on enron until the investigation concludes   said donato eassey of merrill lynch  who lowered his rating on enron  s stock to  neutral  from  accumulate  earlier on thursday 
secured credit  in enron  s case credit lines backed by gas and pipeline assets  often is reserved for companies with  junk  credit ratings  though many analysts saw the credit as a positive for enron 
shares of enron continued their freefall  despite the company  s announcement of new credit lines  after the securities and exchange commission said late wednesday it would make an informal inquiry into the company a full  scale investigation 
enron lost      or    percent  to      resuming a tailspin that began oct   when the company announced it was taking     billion in charges for ill  fated investments 
enron said the investment banking arm of j  p  morgan chase  co  and salomon smith barney inc   the brokerage and investment banking unit of citigroup inc   agreed to provide   billion in credit lines backed by enron  s northern natural gas co  and transwestern pipeline co  assets 
 a positive step 
analysts said it is difficult to gauge the downside of the sec  s probe of enron  which began as a request for information and became a full  fledged investigation  which provides regulators the ability to subpoena company documents 
some analysts said the general economic environment after sept   has tightened lending restrictions and the secured issue is not ominous 
 it is a positive step  they will be surrounded by uncertainty until the sec probe is finalized and then they can go about their business  assuming everything is above board  and they just come out with a conflict of interest  the sec probe will probably result in a fine that will be a significant slap on the wrist   said raymond moore of weatherly securities 
other see it as a possible buying opportunity 
 if the stock price gets to low  double digits  we might change our rating   said mike heim  analyst with a  g  edwards who rates enron as  hold  speculative  
 our decision not to raise our rating when shares dipped below   reflects concerns that enron  s problems may be affecting their trading operations  
enron said the credit lines will be used to supplement short  term liquidity  refinance maturing obligations and augment the   billion the company has of cash on hand  the commitments are subject to customary terms and conditions  including final due diligence  the company said 
 this is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor confidence   said jeffrey mcmahon  enron  s new chief financial officer   we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating

usa  light profit  taking pushes nymex natgas down midday

 c  reuters limited  
san francisco  nov   reuters   nymex hub gas was a touch lower in thin trade midday thursday  pressured by gentle profit  taking  market sources said

 this is just taking profits  the weather is spotty  and the only thing that is going to sustain this uptrend  which i think is already overdone  is an early and sustained winter   one northeast trader said  adding that ample gas supplies would also limit the upside 
other traders said they believed part of the recent run  up in gas prices was due to a steady spate of short  covering in recent days by enron  whose share price has been hammered after a series of disclosures about off  balance  sheet deals with partnerships run by its former chief financial officer 
moody  s investors service cut enron  s credit rating on monday to two notches above junk status and warned it could lower the rating on the company  s senior unsecured debt even further  as well as cut enron  s short  term debt status 
enron is one of largest traders of wholesale natural gas and electricity in the united states 
many dealers said they were a bit surprised by the larger  than  expected build in weekly aga inventory data released wednesday 
aga data showed u  s  gas stocks rose last week by  bcf  below reuters survey estimates for a    bcf build  and well  below the year  ago gain of  bcf and the five  year average injection for this week of  bcf 
total inventories of    tcf are still  bcf  or  percent  above last year and  bcf above the five year average 
traders said some in the producing region may have been selling cheaper baseload gas into the spot market to cash in on the steep premium to index 
storage now stands at  percent full and could still climb to a record    tcf this week  the last week of the stock  building season  traders said 
despite wednesday  s late spike  many traders remained skeptical of the upside  citing concerns about record levels of gas in inventory for winter and sagging demand due to a slowing u  s  economy 
but some said recent talk about further terror attacks in the u  s  created uncertainty in the market that could limit the selling 
in terms of heating degree days  hdds   the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  said it expected  hdds this week  or  below normal  noaa also forecasted  cdds this week  which is  below normal 
the national weather service    day forecast released wednesday called for above normal temperatures for most of the nation  except in the east and parts of the west  where seasonal or below seasonal readings are expected 
noaa recently issued a winter weather outlook calling for colder  than  normal temperatures for northeast  upper midwest and plains states  with the possibility of heavy snow in the midwest and along the east coast 
while chart watchers said the technical picture turned bullish last week when the december gap to     was filled and the down trendline from april was broken  most agreed the upside may be limited near  term by milder late  week weather forecasts 
they now pegged december resistance at wednesday  s high of      with further selling expected at     and then at the august high of

enron falls after sec steps up probe
cbsmarketwatch  com      
houston  cbs  mw    enron shares fell for the  th time in  sessions thursday after the energy merchant said the securities and exchange commission launched a formal investigation into two of its limited partnerships 
late wednesday  the nation  s largest natural gas and power trader said it retained william mclucas  a partner in the washington  d  c   based firm of wilmer  cutler  pickering and a former sec enforcement chief  as its counsel 
mclucas works at the same firm as stephen cutler once did  the sec named cutler its enforcement division chief on oct    giving him oversight of the program in d  c  and in  regional and district offices across the country  according to a sec press release  cutler specialized in  securities enforcement and litigation  while a partner at wilmer  cutler  pickering 
howard meyers  a partner in the new york city  based law firm of meyers  heim and a former staff attorney in the sec  s northeast regional office  said the mclucas  cutler connection could give the appearance of a conflict of interest 
 whether there is or not  i don  t know   he said   if there isn  t an actual conflict  you don  t want to give the appearance of one  the sec is a substantial regulatory agency that the public has to have confidence in  
as new enforcement chief  cutler has a duty to remove himself from any potential conflicts  meyers said 
 generally speaking  i like to see someone a little more removed from any preexisting relationships   he said 
no conflict  enron says
karen denne  an enron spokesperson  said enron is  satisfied that wilmer  cutler has no conflict  and the sec can speak for itself on that issue   she said cutler left wilmer  cutler three years ago and  severed all contacts  
 as you know  the commission conducts its investigations on a non  public basis and thus we cannot confirm or deny the existence of any investigation that may or may not be taking place   said michael robinson  an sec spokesperson   applicable government  wide ethics rules required that mr  cutler recuse himself from all matters involving wilmer  cutler for one year following his departure from the firm  and he did so  
additionally  robinson said   the sec  s ethics office has confirmed that mr  cutler  s involvement in matters in which wilmer  cutler plays a role is entirely consistent with applicable government  wide conflict rules  as well as ethics rules applicable to all attorneys  
enron shares closed at      down      or about  percent  by session  s end   million shares had changed hands 
enron also said it had formed a special committee  headed by university of texas law school dean william powers  to deal with the sec 
john gavin  president of plymouth  minn   based sec insight  said that despite public assurances to the contrary  enron  s announcements wednesday make it apparent that the company has  decided it is no longer in its interest to cooperate with the sec  
 as a formal investigation  the sec must now use its subpoena power to compel the production of documents and witnesses  the assembly of a high  powered legal team is further evidence this company is digging in for a fight   he said 
initially  the sec decided to pursue an informal inquiry into related  party transactions involving the company  now  the sec is making this a formal investigation 
as such  the agency would investigate whether the company disclosed all that was required with regard to the related  party transactions  meyers said  adding that the most important factor in the case  s transition to a formal investigation is that the sec can exercise subpoena power 
disclosure is highly important because it can determine whether an investor buys stock in a company or not  he added  after the existence of the two limited partnerships came to light  the stock plunged 
 the sec might take a look at the auditors of enron  and certainly the sec can take action against the officers of the company   meyers said   any officer that signs off on   qs or   ks could be liable  
merrill lynch analyst donato eassey downgraded enron thursday to  neutral  from  accumulate  buy   citing the uncertainty about the outcome of the sec investigation 
 we believe the timing and directional uncertainty of this new development will at best cap enron  s stock price in the mid  teen  s while increasing overall volatility   eassey wrote in a note to clients  the investigation will way on the stock until it concludes   timing is uncertain  but could feasibly take months  
secures   billion in credit
enron also said it secured   billion in additional financing from j  p  morgan and salomon smith barney 
the new credit  supported by assets of enron  s northern natural gas co  and transwestern pipeline  will help enron shore up its liquidity position 
 we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment  grade rating   said chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon  in a statement
