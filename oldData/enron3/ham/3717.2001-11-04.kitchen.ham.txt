Subject corrections    to rings       
for rings       and   all pjm  i noticed that there is an inconsistency between    the  term  section  which refers to  central prevailing time  and    the  scheduling  section  which refers to  eastern prevailing time  
working under the assumption that the  term  for pjm is supposed to refer to  eastern prevailing time   i changed the  term  section of ring  h  to ept to match the scheduling section 
i suggest we check with melissa murphy tomorrow to confirm the correct time zone for the  term  section of pjm  so that we can make appropriate corrections    either to ring h  or to rings       and
