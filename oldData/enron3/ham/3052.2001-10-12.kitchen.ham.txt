Subject fw  producer one update
louise 
i think what i really wanted to convey is the following 
  john grass originally headed up the wellhead desk and outsourcing efforts for the producer segment  i wanted him to do that because of the logistics overlap between purchasing wellhead gas and offering outsourcing services 
  when the volume of the wellhead desk started to increase and based on my frustation with the lack of  contract focus  with ocean energy  andex  and other producer outsourcing deals being pursued  i asked kevin miller to manage producer outsourcing and john grass to manage only the wellhead desk 
  based on kevin miller  s memo  attached below   the wellhead desk reporting into hunter  i have been questioning the value of a separate outsourcing effort independent of the wellhead desk
