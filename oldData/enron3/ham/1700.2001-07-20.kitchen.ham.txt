Subject fw  portland general electric  order rejecting tariff amendments
ferc rejected the request by pge to modify the code of conduct so that they could buy on enrononline  basically  ferc did not believe that buying thru enrononline was a guarantee that consumers in oregon would not be harmed 
ferc found that there is  for
example  no assurance that the posted prices on enrononline
represent prevailing market prices 
applicants contend that  since pge can transact with epmi
via enrononline only at the posted price  there can be no
affiliate abuse  we are not certain  however  that the posted
price necessarily represents the market price  while  on the
surface  enron online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
auction  the posted prices for any product may not be the result
of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers  in fact 
for sales the posted prices represent what epmi is willing to
sell at  and for purchases the posted prices represent what epmi
is willing to buy at 
ferc left open the idea that pge could re  file to fix the affiliate abuse 
as soon as we hear anything else  i  ll let you know

order rejecting tariff amendments without prejudice
 issued july    
in this order we reject  without prejudice  proposed
amendments of enron power marketing  inc   epmi  and portland
general electric  pge  to their respective market  based rate
tariffs that would allow them to make inter  affiliate sales using
the enrononline trading platform 
i  background
on may     in separate filings  affiliates pge in
docket no  erol     and epmi in docket no  erol    
 collectively applicants  filed to amend their respective market 
based rate schedules to allow for inter  affiliate sales through
the enrononline trading platform  and to prohibit communication
among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on
enrononline or the times that pge will be making trades on

enrononline  this amendment does not supplant the existing
provisions of pge  s and epmi  s currently effective tariffs which
allow for inter  affiliate sales subject to conditions that the
commission generally imposes on inter  affiliate sales where there
are captive customers  e  g   allowing a public utility to sell to
its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower
than the rate it charges non  affiliates  requiring simultaneous
offers to non  affiliates  or requiring use of a relevant 
established index  rather  pge and epmi propose to amend their
respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make

the enrononline system is administered by enron networks 
an enron corp  subsidiary  enrononline is a free  internet 
based  transaction system which allows epmi  s customers to view
real time prices from epmi  s traders and transact instantly
online  enrononline is not an epmi application  but rather
enrononline is a trading platform used as a tool by epmi in
buying from and selling power to third parties 
docket nos  erol       
and erol    
inter  affiliate sales via enrononline  with restrictions
different than those in place but that  they state  will still
prevent affiliate abuse  applicants state that the commission  s
requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in
electronic commerce and  in particular  the commission  s
requirement that  pge post on its website notice of a potential
purchase or sale with epmi prior to pge entering into the
transaction with epmi prohibits pge from using enrononline  since
enrononline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not
provide for a waiting period before consummating the

transaction   according to applicants  this deprives pge of the
ability to buy or sell power  from perhaps the largest marketer

in its region  to the detriment of pge and its ratepayers  
ii  notice of filing and interventions  protests
notices of the filings were published in the federal
register   fed  reg         docket no  erol      
and  fed  reg         docket no  erol       with
motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before

iii  discussion
the commission allows power marketers and their public
utility affiliates to sell to one another at market  based rates
when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate
abuse  as the commission has explained  affiliate abuse can
occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers
sells power at below  market prices to  or purchases power at
above  market prices from  an affiliate without captive customers
 such as a power marketer affiliate   one way in which the
commission has sought to prevent this type of cross  subsidization
by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter  affiliate

sales at an established  relevant market price or index 
another way  when there is no assurance that the affiliates are
transacting at the prevailing market price  is to adopt various
conditions previously established by the commission to prevent

affiliate abuse

here  applicants request that the commission permit them to
use enrononline to make inter  affiliate sales  subject to the
following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient
protection against affiliate abuse  pge  when buying from epmi
using enrononline  will be required to  take the transaction
price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular

location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment   in

addition  pge will be prohibited from submitting limit orders or
engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity
of the counter  party is revealed to epmi prior to the transaction
being finalized  applicants also propose to amend their
respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication
regarding prices posted on enrononline 
applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate
abuse occurs since pge will only be able to transact with epmi at

the public utility paid non  affiliates under certain standard

epmi application at   pge application at  

in the case of a limit order on enrononline  epmi would
know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or
lower than that currently available  applications at   while
applicants do not define  limit order   the common understanding
is that  unlike a market order  which instructs a broker to
transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in
the marketplace  a limit order instructs a broker to fill the
order only if certain conditions are met  generally  a limit
order may be either a day order  in which case it expires when
the market closes if unfilled  or good  until  canceled  in which
case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled 
docket nos  erol       
and erol    
the posted price  a price that is offered to all market
participants  and there will be no transactions in which epmi
knows that pge is the counter  party before the transaction is
finalized  thus  applicants contend that not only will pge be
unable to negotiate special terms with epmi through enrononline 
but epmi will have no discretion to take actions which favor pge 
applicants further offer that procedures are performed by
computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of
pge  in addition  because the enrononline price is posted
electronically and is available to all market participants 
applicants state that pge  s customers have the opportunity to
transact with epmi on enrononline on the same terms and
conditions that are available to pge 
applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed
restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the
commission  s affiliate abuse requirements and conditions  e  g  
protection against pge buying too high or selling too low in its

transactions with its affiliate epmi   the thrust of
applicants  argument is that the commission  s affiliate abuse
concerns are satisfied by using enrononline  a public medium  for
selling power between affiliates  we disagree  while perhaps
faster and easier to use than phone calls  faxes  or letters  an
internet  based platform is just another medium for trade  and
speed and ease of use do not dictate that the commission  s
affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied  there is  for
example  no assurance that the posted prices on enrononline

represent prevailing market prices 
applicants contend that  since pge can transact with epmi
via enrononline only at the posted price  there can be no
affiliate abuse  we are not certain  however  that the posted
price necessarily represents the market price  while  on the
surface  enron online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
auction  the posted prices for any product may not be the result
of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers  in fact 
for sales the posted prices represent what epmi is willing to
sell at  and for purchases the posted prices represent what epmi

is willing to buy at  for other transactions through media
other than enrononline  including other exchanges  epmi might be

see supra notes    and accompanying text  citing cases
that discuss commission  s underlying concerns with affiliate
power sales  

see supra note  and accompanying text 

all transaction on enrononline involve epmi as a
participant  for sales  epmi is the seller  for purchases  epmi
is the buyer 
docket nos  erol       
and erol    

willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices 
moreover  applicants provide no information about how product
prices posted by epmi are determined  or whether there would be
any restrictions on what products pge could trade via
enrononline  or even whether there are other similar  but non 
affiliated  internet  based venues where pge can electronically
trade those products to attain similar benefits 
having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be
transacting at a prevailing market price via enrononline  we now
turn to whether the applicants have met other conditions
established by the commission to prevent affiliate abuse 
regarding transactions in which epmi may be purchasing from pge
through enrononline  there is nothing in the applicants  proposed
restrictions that would require pge to
simultaneously offer to sell to non  affiliates at the same rate
offered to the affiliate  the commission requires that  with
respect to any power offered to its affiliate  pge make the same
offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its
electronic bulletin board  but it is unclear whether pge can or
will make the same offer to non  affiliates 
applicants also offer as a protection that pge is prohibited
from submitting limit orders  which would prevent epmi from
knowing that pge is the counter  party to a transaction  again 
this would not prevent epmi from selling power to pge at above 
market prices 
the commission is not assured by the applicants  proposal
that transactions between pge and epmi conducted via enrononline
will occur in a manner that is consistent with the commission  s
expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for
inter  affiliate power sales transactions  there is  for example 
no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how
unaffiliated customers  or other interested parties  would
monitor inter  affiliate transactions 
for the above reasons  we will reject the proposed
amendments  without prejudice to applicants revising their
proposal to address the commission  s concerns and incorporating
appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse 

likewise  pge might be willing to buy at lower prices and
sell at higher prices

applicants  proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected 
without prejudice  as discussed in the body of this order
