subject  december crude
tomorrow is the final day to schedule december barrels  and we are currently short      barrels  we have exhausted all measures of buying crude including  settling sales financially  buying from companies where we have short positions  and selling physical puts  as a group  we have reduced our short physical position from over  million barrels to    under extremely difficult credit terms  we believe we cannot cover the remaining    without prepaying a counterparty  this requires a cash infusion of approximately           x      barrel  
every effort will be made within the next  hours to reduce this position  but the outlook is not bright  please let me know as soon as possible what can be made available to us 
sincerely 
rob fuller
