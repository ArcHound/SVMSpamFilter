Subject fw  real estate issues re  ubsw energy  llc in houston
i  m thinking  and  are not as nice as  and   but that this would be ok  and preferable to moving to the north tower and that we should be trying for a longer lease  with breaks we can exercise at our option  we should be in a good negotiating position

subject  real estate issues re  ubsw energy  llc in houston
hello pat  louise  dave
the ubsw real estate department is reviewing the current  future lease
terms for ubsw energy llc  in houston  according to brian dugan  our
lead real estate guy on the bank side  the building owner has offered
a nine month lease to stay in the south tower on the  th and  th
floors  after the nine months we will be offered the option to sign
up for an additional  months but we could be moved down to floors 
and   is this a significant issue  i understand that the  rd and
 th floor foot prints are similar to    
if ubsw energy is willing to relocate to the north tower  they can
get a lease for    years but this tower may be less suitable  what
are the issues here 
the integration real estate team plans to meet this afternoon with
the bank  s outside legal firm we use for real estate issues  we have
a target date of this friday to try to resolve all real estate issues
in order to meet the day  legal integration date of
