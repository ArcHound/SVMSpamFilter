Subject southwest power financing
louise 
i spoke to chip and he mentioned your concern  question about the financing of this project  to be clear  the turbines and some of the equipment are in turbopark  however  global finance does not want to construct this project inside of turbopark because accounting believes that would be problematic for our fair market value treatment of our merchant investments  global finance  s plan is to provide a jedi ii  ena bridge loan to the project for the non  turbine construction costs through a bridge loan from may  through sep   the expected loan amount during this time period is   mm  split between ena and jedi ii  our economics assume the bridge loan is priced at    global finance has committed to arrange non  recourse project financing so that ena  jedi will have only a   mm combined investment once the financing closes by sep   also during this time period we will be actively marketing the project with the intent to divest of it fully prior to sep  
hopefully that clarifies things
