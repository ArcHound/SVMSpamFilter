attached is a memo comparing the cec  s forecasted supply and a more realistic look at what additional resources might be available this summer 
the bottom line is that 
  the cec significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this summer  they estimate in their    mw supply deficit for the summer that expected outages will be around    mw  however  november and december saw significantly higher outage levels      mws  the ferc has investigated these outages and found no improprieties  just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities 
  there are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the    mws of projected supply from rerating  restarting existing thermal and renewable projects  it is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer  if at all  as evidenced by the e  mail i sent out this morning  local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units  in addition  these units are likely to be uneconomical 
  in the existing resource pool  there are roughly    mws of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations  the governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions  we are beginning to seem some movement  however  the us epa has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards 
  the distributed generation  back  up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown  while there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back  up generation at  essential public services  the increase in dg is expected from  clean  sources  not diesel emergency generators 
  the cec is doing everything it can to get   mw peaking units on  line by this summer  they are promising a   day permit application approval process and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets  for  clean  sources of generation in critical areas 
please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information
