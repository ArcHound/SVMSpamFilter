 san joaquin could be sold for a   mm    mm gain  we are proceeding with calpine  cantor and enron desk 
 sale of roseville and bay area erc  s would result in a significant discount        because the air districts would be upset  basically  they could apply a transfer discount to the credits of      and also could make future transfers conditional upon their approval  increasing risk for buyer  
 sale would also cause collateral damage to any future erc activities  enron would be seen as speculator  carpetbagger 
recommendation 
pursue sale of san joaquin credits and put the balance in the global finance funding vehicle  initial indication is that transfer of credits for finance purposes is easy for an air district to accept  i am setting up a call to discuss with finance  legal and kelly brodbeck
