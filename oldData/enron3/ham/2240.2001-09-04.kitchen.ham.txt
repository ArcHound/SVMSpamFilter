Subject re  follow up on hiring issues last week
my only concern is that john  i am told  spoke to gas and power folks at his staff meeting a while back on the process on transfers  as long as they are rated a  or higher in prc then they did not need to have it approved  most go through hr  however  some we find out after the fact  i am just trying to make sure we could meet your expectation  do you want to say something at your next staff meeting

louise  prior to you sending me the revised guidelines on transfers  hires last week  i wanted to give you details on the folks that were already in process before the change 
  steve bartlet received a transfer offer from lloyd don miller in asset market effective       don had indicated that he had planned to speak to you monday       he did considerable investigation on this employee to ascertain that he would be a fit for the group  the employee was rated a  at midyear 
  dave ingram was hired by dana davis to do realtime trading at the senior specialist level  he was a transfer from ebs as a redeployed employee  feedback was positive and he was rated a  at mid year and excellent at yearend 
  eric simpson was hired to work for fletch sturm as a commerical director  he was rated  at midyear and a  at yearend  as per the email i recceived from kevin presto  i am told that both you and john are aware 
  berney aucoin in ews made an offer to an analyst out of the program for a specialist level  flat compensation   rogers herndon approved as this employee was rated a  at midyear  however  they feel in the past that he was not appropriately guided at ews  they feel that they can assist in turning this employee around and have developed a performance improvement plan  robert jones is aware 
  steve irvin was in the process of making an offer to carlos alatorre for the monterrey office  i believe that you are aware as this employee would be a transfer from eol  i am awaiting a response from steve on the status 
i will be sending out a note to kevin  dave  don  steve  rogers and both jaimes to let them know about the change in process on what you would like to be included on going forward
