it looks to be another four to six months before nymex launches its
electronic trading platform enymex  designed to provide a neutral
trading platform for traditionally over  the  counter products  the delay
comes in part as nymex begins offering its after  hours access electronic
trading system via the internet next week 
the introduction of access to the internet poses some new questions
for nymex  especially how it will integrate access with enymex  nymex  s
nachamah jacobovits explained  the two platforms will remain separate 
but the idea is to allow easy trading between the two  she noted 
nymex had to delay an anticipated second  quarter launch for enymex
this year after canceling a contract with a software provider that was
developing the link between the order matching system and screen layout
for the new platform  the exchange has been working with the remaining
software vendors and staff to complete the platform 
as it stands now  enymex would offer a variety of gas swap contracts
related to the henry hub and other pricing points  as well as crude oil 
heating oil and gasoline calendar swaps 
enymex promises to be a neutral  open trading platform without
counterparty credit risk  offering standardized basis products tied to
the exchange  s most liquid benchmark products  its development was first
announced in may   sgs
