Subject new calpine twist
it  s getting strange   
calpine wants to see our offer 
big prepay    mm    mm
epmi sells  mw   x 
dp  np   or sp  
price   
start    
term     years
rationale  they have   dwr contracts  at this point the dwr contracts are tied to their accrual generation business  if we pay them for the right to sell    s  they can get the cash and recognize the earnings 
like the rest of this story  selling to a generator sounds strange  however  if the forward market is trading below their stated price forecast  they may want to buy  not sell 
perhaps we go down a parallel path  bids in the east  offers in the west 
maybe we end up in a seller  financing deal  loan  for investment in new power and purchase of sites  equipment  erc  s 
dave and i are available to compare notes and discuss strategy
