can you confirm how many people are attending this meeting from our side  it seems to be getting a little large and i think we need to make sure we are only bringing people that can add significant value to the actual meeting 
my count is as follows 
marc ulrich  urm  he is the commercial expert on comed and rate effects on our business  mandatory
jeff merola  manager of physical delivery logistics for central region  mandatory
brad snyder  structured supply
mark bernstein  structured supply
jeff ader  structured supply
janine migden  regulatory
roy boston  regulatory
rogersherndon  ews risk
name i forgot  legal  ulrich recomended he go given the comed audience
this would be   i think this is too much  what are your thoughts 
given the agenda items of   comed ppo phase  out intentions    physical delivery issues and   potential business transactions b  w comed and enron  i think we need to trim the list of attendees
