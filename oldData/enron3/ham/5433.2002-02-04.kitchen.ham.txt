Subject canadian regulatory approvals
further to my previous email  competition act canada and investment canada act approvals are currently contemplated as conditions to closing 
we  ecc  have provided ubs and its counsel with all information and warranties that they need to convince themselves that no pre  closing approvals are needed in the circumstances  they only need to make a post  closing notification   but it is ultimately their decision  and we have yet to hear back from their counsel  although we don  t anticipate any problem
