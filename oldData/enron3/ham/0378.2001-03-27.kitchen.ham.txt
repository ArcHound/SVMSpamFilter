we didn  t get to finish our conversation in the elevator re  ngpl 
do we expect them to repsond to us  if they think the price is too high then we can start negotiating  if they think any price is too high then we have a problem  given that you have a relationship with the person in charge there  getting a response from them will really help us figure out whether this is going to fly or not 
thanks
