we will receive the   million when aes and tva execute an interconnection agreement for aes  haywood project  while it is possible that this agreement will be executed this month      it  s equally as likely that it will happen q   aes is currently under construction on their haywood project  and as such  they need to get this agreement wrapped up asap  our role in this is to utilize our resources  primarily our consultant who is a former tva director  to help aes through the process  and in doing so  we will receive our upside payment of   million   we are doing everything we can to reach this milestone in q  
we can talk about this before our conference call if you like 
regards
