drop in natural  gas prices may be good for consumers but hinder new production

in the wake of last month  s terrorist attacks  natural  gas prices have slid below   per million british thermal units  frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural  gas projects 
analysts predict that with prices at current levels  projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the u  s  could be shelved or canceled 
natural  gas prices  which reached highs of nearly   per million btus last december  had held to around   to   per million btus for much of the year  at   per million btus and below  producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production 
analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand  fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric  utility demand  nearby november futures fell  cents yesterday to     on the new york mercantile exchange 
in the boston area  however  different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region  last week  the u  s  coast guard  under pressure from local lawmakers  indefinitely banned lng tankers from entering boston harbor  lng makes up   of new england  s gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days  the coast guard and department of transportation are studying concerns that a lng tanker could become a bomb for terrorists 
already  relative to other areas  natural  gas prices have inched higher in new england  where natural  gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market  the spread between prices in new england and the gulf coast widened last week by  cents to     per million btus  said a spokeswoman for distrigas  a unit of belgium  s tractebel sa  but the lack of lng isn  t likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural  gas storage is used up 
richard grant  ceo of distrigas  says lng has a   year safety record at the company  s everett  mass   terminal  while lng is flammable  he says it is unlikely to explode  he adds that  there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual  but until we answer the concerns  we won  t be able to bring a ship in here  
deutsche banc alex  brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth  quarter projections for natural  gas prices last week   prior to sept    we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back   said jay saunders  a deutsche banc analyst   but all that is out the window now   deutsche banc is now estimating a   drop in winter demand in the industrial sector  which accounts for more than a quarter of total u  s  natural  gas consumption  the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage  which is on pace to be full by the end of october 
while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers  such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural  gas demand is met  lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms  such as eog resources inc   plan to moderate production in the next two months  gas drilling  rig counts fell to  last week from    at the end of august 
even with the increased natural  gas drilling of earlier this year  overall natural  gas supply is expected to increase just   this year  as the country  s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them  the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates  increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence 
still  the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form  with prices high last winter  el paso corp  and enron corp   among others  said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas  which is gas compressed and frozen to minus   degrees fahrenheit   you will see some cancellations and some delays   predicts marshall adkins  an analyst with raymond james  associates in houston 
natural  gas prices need to average   per million btus on the east coast and     on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas  said ronald barone  an analyst with ubs warburg 
a spokeswoman for el paso  houston  says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u  s  market  enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in

after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra  kurla complex  enron has been able lease out    square feet of it to citibank na 
against an expected realisation from rs  crore for the outright sale of its four floors  enron will get around rs    crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank 
the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant  cushman  wakefield  at a monthly rental of rs  per square foot 
with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the
short run  companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets 
property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors  it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer  as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income 
enron had eyed a deal of rs  crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs    per square foot 
this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs    to rs    per square feet  in june   the us energy giant had shelled out rs    crore when it acquired the four floors  plus car park space  from wockhardt  the pharmaceutical company 
the deal was struck at rs    per sq ft  and included parking space for  cars 
industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs  crore to acquire the property  and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired 
in order for it to break even  it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs    per square foot 
four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises  a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property 
 most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase   he added 
moreover  the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built  up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises  and enron  s proposition continues to go abegging  said the consultant

though hewlett  packard lost   billion in market value in a year  ceo carly fiorina hasn  t lost her nerve  and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no   position on fortune  s ranking of the  most powerful women in business 
the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october  issue of fortune  available on newsstands october  and at www  fortune  com at    p  m  on october  
in the no   spot is ebay ceo meg whitman  who runs an internet company that actually makes money    million in the last four quarters on   million in revenue  oprah winfrey  the queen of media  is mightier than ever  and holds the no   spot  up from no   last year  she produces movies  brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers  propels books to bestsellerdom  and  last year  teamed up with hearst magazines  cathie black  no   on the list  to publish o  the oprah magazine  by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever  at no   is andrea jung  chairman and ceo of avon  who has breathed life into ailing avon  mirant ceo marce fuller  the only newcomer in the top five  holds the no   position  inside a stodgy utility  southern  fuller built a high  growth trading and marketing unit  which was spun off in april 
in these new  more tempered times  patience may be about to reap its reward  in fortune  s annual survey of the  most powerful women in business  there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly  says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in  patient but not passive   the story that accompanies the list   by patience  we mean staying with a company  steadily building influence there  and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge  not promises and self  promotion  
fiorina  who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune  s inaugural list in   heads the biggest company    billion in revenues last year  run by a woman  and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever  wall street practically heckled her latest move  a bold bet to buy compaq  but fiorina    remains defiant  in difficult times   people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny   she says 
as always  the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time  last year  power resided in the technology and internet sectors  but that influence was fleeting  gone from the list this year  deborah  hurricane debby  hopkins  who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may  ellen hancock  who failed at the startup  exodus  and morgan stanley  s mary meeker  who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz  but one web warrior looks better than ever  meg whitman  no   on the list  she has never overpromised to investors  instead she has diligently delivered above  target profits every single quarter 
fourteen newcomers join the list this year  marce fuller  president louise kitchen  coo  enron americas  colleen barrett  president betsy bernard  president  ceo  at anne stevens  vp  north america vehicle operations  ford motor  maria elena lagomasino  chairman susan desmond  hellman  evp and chief medical officer  genentech  janet robinson  svp  newspaper operations  new york times co   carol tomi  evp and cfo  home depot  carrie cox  evp and president  global prescriptions  pharmacia  carole black  president and ceo  lifetime television networks  janet davidson  group president  integrated network solutions  lucent  larree renda  evp  retail operations  safeway  and louise francesconi  vp and gm  missile systems  raytheon 
while the economy and its points of power change  the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same  says sellers   we consider the size and importance of a woman  s business in the global economy  her clout inside her company  and the arc of her career  where she has been and where she is likely to go  when appropriate  we also weigh the woman  s influence on mass culture and society  that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no   on this year  s list   the shifts on our list this year are dramatic  with  newcomers  but one trend is especially intriguing  women are taking on bigger businesses than ever  a few years ago  responsibility for a   billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list  no more  this year  s fortune  includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of   billion or more  which is a first 
in a related story   it took a lady to save avon   katrina brooker looks at andrea jung  chairman and ceo of avon  says brooker   jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them  and that  s what has made her one of the most successful ceos  male or female  in recent years   over the past  months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business  how it advertises  manufactures  packages  and even sells its products  and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady  but by reviving her  the result  growth in revenues  operating profits  and operating margins
