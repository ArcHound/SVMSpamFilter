Subject vitro
louise 
we are selling vitro for an enterprise value  ev  of     mm    mm in debt    mm in book equity      mm premium from tractebel for    and     mm implied premium for our   stake  
ebitda for   first full year of operation  is   mm for an ev  ebitda multiple of    x 
using the average ebitda for  years of   mm you end up an ev  ebitda multiple of    x 
in my mind  both are great multiples for a project such as vitro  the nice fact is that we get     mm from tractebel with   mm invested for our    or a net negative   million investment in the project 
let me know if you need anything else 
thanks
