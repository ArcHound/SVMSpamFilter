 copyright  c    dow jones nor will it comment on whether it had approached potential investors about a possible capital infusion  however  the continued plunge in enron shares and turmoil surrounding the company are a significant  overreaction in the marketplace  our core businesses are strong   he says  the company has said that it is taking steps to restore investor confidence 
for example  enron is trying to negotiate a new credit line with its major banks  late yesterday  enron  s bankers were putting the final touches on a new credit line of more than   billion  according to people familiar with the discussions 
analysts and other observers say that one uncertainty surrounding enron is the condition of its vast energy  trading operation  as the nation  s biggest energy trader  enron is a principal in one  quarter of all electricity and natural  gas trades  enron  s enrononline internet  based trading platform has transacted more than   billion of trades since it was created in november  and does about   billion a day in transactions 
one worry is that enron  s trading partners  edgy about the turmoil swirling around the company  will start demanding much tougher credit terms from the houston company or simply cut back doing business  such a trend  if it picked up enough momentum  could have troubling consequences for enron   we are all in suspense     it all depends on how the market reacts   says susan abbott  a managing director at moody  s investors service  on monday  moody  s downgraded enron  s long  term debt 
there were some warning signs of unease among trading partners even before the company  s third  quarter earnings release set the stage for the huge drop in the stock price  about six to seven weeks ago  entergy corp  became worried about its level of exposure in enron  related deals  says wayne leonard  chairman and chief executive officer of the big new orleans energy company  since then  entergy has cut its enron exposure to about   million to   million from   million to   million  he says  mr  leonard didn  t specify what prompted the worries  which appear to have arisen after the surprise august announcement by jeffrey skilling that he was resigning as enron president and chief executive  mr  skilling cited personal reasons as well as his concerns over the falling stock price 
while the enron spokesman says the company doesn  t comment on specific trading arrangements  he adds that entergy is one of his company  s smaller trading partners  he says major trading partners are doing business with enron on  essentially the same terms and conditions  and that overall  our trading operations are as strong as ever  
the company spokesman adds that a few smaller trading partners in europe are seeking revised credit terms from enron   we are working to put together credit terms  which they are more comfortable with   says the spokesman  who declines to be more specific 
in an effort to bolster its liquidity and position in the marketplace  enron last week drew down some   billion  accounting for the bulk of its existing credit lines  while it used most of that money to buy its outstanding commercial paper  a short  term corporate iou  the company retained about   billion of the borrowings as cash 
a friendly takeover of all or part of enron would be likelier than a hostile one  among the most obvious candidates would be other companies with big trading operations and experience in risk management  two possible deterrents to a would  be buyer  a flurry of recent shareholder lawsuits filed against enron and the continuing sec probe

shell transport underperformed bp on speculation that it might be poised to launch a multi  billion dollar bid for enron of the us 
the company is believed to have been in talks with the indebted energy group earlier in the year 
enron has a market capitalisation of around   bn  analysts say shell would probably not have to offer a huge premium and could afford to fund a deal with cash  shell said it would not comment on the speculation 
enron would be a good fit but earlier this week moody  s became the first of the main rating agencies to downgrade the houston  based company  s debt by lowering it to just two notches above  junk  status citing  the deterioration in enron  s financial flexibility  
steve turner of commerzbank said   i think the market would be very nervous if shell were to launch a bid for enron because of the uncertainty about enron  s balance sheet  
there was another judder to the share price from speculation that moeara enim  an investment vehicle whose sole asset is a  m share stake in royal dutch  faces a bid and break up by fortis  the dutch  belgian financial group  shell fell     to  p and bp dropped     to     p 
vodafone accounted for  per cent of the footsie fall after the mobile phone group  which has rallied sharply since september   came off the boil 
the shares dropped     to     p on turnover of  m shares  almost  per cent of the total traded across the uk market 
the shares had rallied  per cent over the past six weeks and several brokers had started to call the top  the latest to downgrade was commerzbank which moved its stance to  reduce  from  hold  with a fair value estimate of  p a share 
the broker  s move reflected worries that vodafone  s recent revenue per user figures were not sufficient to bolster confidence in forecasts of longer  term sustained customer revenue growth 
colt profits taken
elsewhere in the sector  colt telecom fell     to     p as investors took profits and merrill lynch downgraded estimates 
merrill said that after colt  s recent disappointing third quarter results  it had cut its revenue forecasts for  and  by  per cent and  per cent respectively 
colt had jumped more than  per cent on monday on talk that cable  wireless might launch a bid 
 i fell  to  p after an early release of the group  s interim results showed that net asset value per share had slid    per cent to  p  the company said it had decided on an early release of its results as it was also announcing organisational changes  it said it was cutting  per cent of its workforce in an effort to maintain a strong balance sheet amid poor market conditions 
close brothers fell  to  p as the merchant bank said it remained cautious about the outlook 
london bridge software fell  to     p as nomura downgraded its rating and forecasts to reflect the group  s high level of us exposure 
spirent fell another  to     p as deutsche bank became the latest broker to issue cautious advice  it started coverage of the communications testing group with a  market perform  stance  saying near  term sector risks outweighed the long  term prospects 
medisys gained  to     p after dresdner kleinwort wasserstein initiated coverage on the stock with a  buy  recommendation 
shares in gkn fell  to  p after the automotive and aerospace engineer announced that it is to shed    jobs  including some in the uk  the cuts are likely to be concentrated in the civil aerospace area which has suffered heavily  credit suisse first boston cut its profit forecasts for the next two years 
bullough  the engineering holding company  said any improvement in trading in the second half is unlikely  its shares fell     to  p 
british american tobacco brought some cheer to the ftse  as its shares rose     or almost  per cent to     p after the company said its four global brands showed an overall growth rate of  per cent and reported robust nine month results 
bat on the rise
michael smith  an analyst at morgan stanley dean witter said third quarter results were  slightly better than expected  and showed that bat can meet its numbers for the full year 
 it can achieve  per cent earnings growth for the full year  he said  but although there was plenty of reassurance for this year  next year will be more of a challenge   weak macro  economic conditions and smokers downtrading to cheaper brands are likely to prove a problem next year   he said  another concern will be countries such as germany and malaysia where tax on cigarettes is increasing 
some of the fizz went out of alcoholic drinks groups as two leading companies in the sector made cautious comments about future growth prospects after the september  terrorist attacks on the us  despite reporting robust full  year results  allied domecq shares fell  to     p as the group warned that future earnings growth will be harder to achieve than last year 
merrill lynch said that trading profit was  per cent ahead of estimates at   m  against the broker  s forecast of   m but merrill analyst mark puleikis said there will be two hits to profits going forward 
 allied will spend   m on it over the next few years and a further de  stocking programme of   m per annum over the next two years   he said  the broker gave a discounted cash flow forecast of  p and retained its  neutral  recommendation  the broker said it continued to prefer diageo 
abn amro also retained its  hold  stance 
leisure and hotel group whitbread gained     to  p after reporting a  per cent drop in first half profits  in line with analysts expectations  abn amro said it anticipates about a  per cent upgrade to its profit before tax estimate for  and retained its  add  stance  while ing barings charterhouse securities switched its recommendation from  hold  to  buy   regular uk equities updates at www  ft  com  equities

 leadership in turbulent times   organised by fortune magazine  is a benefit conference to tackle the  extraordinary new challenges  faced by us companies in the aftermath of september

a timely question  investors have dumped enron in recent weeks  triggered by credit rating downgrades  lingering questions over the company  s off  balance  sheet deals and potential conflicts of interest for its former chief financial officer 
times are perhaps too turbulent for lay  he cancelled his appearance

waiting for balance sheets amid enron  s debacle  david wilson
 commentary  david wilson is a columnist for bloomberg news 
the opinions expressed are his own  
princeton  new jersey  oct    bloomberg    international
business machines corp   s press release about its third  quarter
results included this statement  attributed to louis gerstner 
chairman and chief executive officer 
  ibm  s balance sheet remains among the strongest in the
technology industry  or any industry   
the largest maker of computers and provider of computer
services wasn  t the only company to cite its balance sheet  a
statistical summary of what a company owned  what it owed  and
what was left over for shareholders on a specific date 
general electric co   the largest company by stock market
value  and citigroup inc   the no   financial  services company 
made similar references in their third  quarter releases 
none of the companies really showed people what they were
telling them  ibm  general electric and citigroup are among 
members of the dow jones industrial average whose most recent
quarterly releases didn  t include balance sheets 
the evidence will come only when the companies submit their
quarterly reports to the u  s  securities and exchange commission 
balance sheets are required in the so  called   q filings  along
with the   k filings that cover the full year 
not much publicity
by then  statistics about the companies  assets  liabilities
and shareholders  equity  the accounting terms for what  s owned 
what  s owed and what  s left over  will be rather outdated 
u  s  companies have  days from the end of a fiscal quarter
to submit   q reports  and  days from the end of a fiscal year
for   k reports 
these filings usually don  t arrive until weeks after the
publication of earnings releases  so it  s easy to overlook the
additional information they provide  especially when it doesn  t
receive the kind of publicity that the earnings release does 
yet the recent example of enron corp    another company that
omits balance sheets from press releases   provides evidence that
investors who forgo the extra effort needed to find them do so at
their own peril 
enron  the largest energy trader  reported     billion in
  non  recurring   costs in the third quarter from an expansion
into water  telecommunications and retail  energy sales  the
expense contributed to a   million loss for the quarter 
these numbers were part of the houston  based company  s income
statement  a summary of sales  costs and expenses  and profits or
losses during a specified time period  income statements are the
cornerstone of any company  s earnings release 
billion  dollar numbers
the release didn  t even mention a larger figure that affected
the balance sheet  a     billion drop in shareholders  equity
during the quarter  chairman and ceo kenneth lay disclosed the
repurchase in a subsequent conference call 
this decline resulted from the company  s repurchase of 
million shares from two partnerships  ljm cayman lp and ljm  co 
investment lp  that helped finance projects  andrew fastow  who
ran both partnerships  was ousted from his job as chief financial
officer last week 
such a one  two punch dealt a blow to investors  fortunes 
since oct    the day after the earnings release  enron  s shares
have fallen each day and have lost two  thirds of their value  the
low of     yesterday was the lowest price since july  
enron  s third  quarter statement referred only to a loss on
  finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity   which
contributed to   million of investment losses  the size of that
item was later put at   million 
the latter number amounts to just    percent of the overall
figure for   non  recurring   costs  and less than  percent of the
company  s     billion in revenue for the quarter 
growing debt burden
the     billion figure is considerably larger not only in
dollars  but also in percentage terms  enron had     billion of
shareholders  equity as of june   according to the balance sheet
in its second  quarter   q filing  the reduction equaled more than
 percent of that total 
among other things  the balance sheet also shows that the
company relied more heavily on debt financing during this year  s
first half  short  term debt  due in one year or less  doubled to
    billion  long  term debt  maturing in more than one year 
rose    percent to     billion 
there  s even more to the story of enron  s indebtedness  the
company guaranteed     billion in borrowing by osprey trust and
marlin water trust  which bought some of its power plants  unless
they pay off the debt by reselling the plants  the company may
have to come up with the difference 
nevertheless  any summary of a company  s financial position
provides a more complete picture than the income statement alone 
this also holds true for companies whose finances are in better
shape   ibm  general electric and citigroup  to name three 
knowing by showing
other members of the dow industrials that wait until their
filings to provide balance sheets are american express co   at  t

citigroup  s third  quarter earnings release has this quote
from sandy weill  chairman and ceo    we have the balance sheet
strength to make timely acquisitions to expand our franchises   
the new york  based company had more than   billion of   total
equity    weill said in the statement 
general electric  s release quoted chairman and ceo jeffrey
immelt as saying   our strong balance sheet  which gives us the
flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities    is one of the
fairfield  connecticut  based company  s   fundamental strengths   
investors can only take these ceos at their word for now 
their companies  and many others  are only telling rather than
showing   at least in their earnings releases

throughout this tremendous downturn in the fortunes of big  cap stocks turned small  cap and large growth stocks turned into small value plays  we have seen mutual fund families fall by the wayside as they weren  t able to dodge the quickly changing market 
we tend to want to believe that it is just stock selection that sunk a first hands or a janus or an invesco or a van wagoner or those ne  er  do  well putnam funds 
but it  s not  it  s also trading  many of the funds that gained great renown in the  s that have now fallen on such hard times since the bear market began in  are funds that don  t know how to sell  that don  t know how to get out of stocks 
you won  t read this kind of criticism in the mutual fund ratings  which tend to be antiseptic and mathematically derived  and you won  t read it in the magazines like money or the smartmoney  outlets that  while strong in some departments  really don  t understand trading at all 
but it is what determines good from bad in tough markets  and right now you are seeing some really horrible trading from some of these giant mutual funds  they are simply unable to extricate themselves from loser positions without hurting themselves on the go out 
trading  s an art  for those of you who are football fans  trading is like what happens in the interior line  the trenches  you know that  s where the game can be decided  basketball fans  trading is the movement of other players who don  t have the ball  it is the invisible game that determines what is going to happen 
i take it seriously because i was a trader and most of my friends are traders  we will often joke about how some of these mutual funds just don  t have a clue when they are trying to get out of stocks  they blow them to kingdom come with their sloppiness and their inability to execute 
others  however  can trade magnificently and know how to play the game  have you noticed  for example  i never make fun of fidelity in my litany of fund criticism  one of the reasons is that fidelity is a fabulous trader  fido has a great trading desk that is incredibly adept at getting in and out of stocks  they are masters  it saves their portfolio managers  fortunes  i know this because i have handled their orders and because i have many friends who currently handle their orders and we all talk  as we always have  about this stuff every day 
when we look at sagas like enron  ene  nyse  news  commentary   where mutual funds were caught trying to exit  caught like trapped deer on an interstate  we have to remember that not all mutual fund trading desks are created equally  some simply don  t have a clue 
getting out of stock  especially when you have built up a huge concentration in one position  is an art  an art that many funds of the world never had  they even denigrated the profession by never emphasizing it as a virtue  in these days when the market blitzes positions it doesn  t like  if you don  t have a good trading line  you could be history 
many of these mutual fund  families  will turn out to be history when this era ends  don  t let them make your nest egg history  too  especially when there are other fund groups that do know the value of good trading and can handle these markets with much more poise and far fewer losses 
random musings  pit yourself against others and make money in our trading contest  and create a record to show others that you know how to trade so you can catch on with or create your own hedge fund  that  s what this contest is all about  click here for more info 
s  p analyst todd shipman on enron corp   credit rating comment
         new york 
new york  oct    bloomberg    todd shipman  a director at
standard  poor  s  a credit rating company  comments on enron
corp  the houston  based largest energy trader 
s  p affirmed the company  s long  term credit rating at
  bbb    on oct    it lowered its outlook to negative from
stable following the announcement that the u  s  securities and
exchange commission is investigating the company  s financial
dealings with affiliates that were run by ousted chief financial
officer andrew fastow 
enron  s shares have fallen  percent this year  they
finished yesterday down      or  percent  to     
  what little bit of credibility management had with
investors has continued to erode    he said 
  people  i don  t believe  are acting based on facts that are
coming out    they are trading on the   uncertainty as to what the
real story is  what the exposures are  and what enron will do to
rectify the situation 
  until enron gets out there to explain what the facts are
and what they are going to do about it  you could see a
continuation of these problems 
  the market is dealing with an information vacuum of the
company  s own making  in the face of that uncertainty  it looks to
me like there are more and more people bailing out   
on s  p  s negative outlook 
traders see differences between the terms   negative
creditwatch   and   negative outlook    he said 
  i consider both to be serious indications that there is a
chance the rating is going to be downgraded  and i wouldn  t
hesitate  if it were justified  to downgrade enron off a negative
outlook  it is just as likely from a negative outlook as from a
negative creditwatch   
  creditwatch is tied much more to an event   
  negative outlook should be sending just as serious a signal
as a negative creditwatch would   
on counterparty exposure 
  i fully expected   counterparties to cut back their
exposure    it doesn  t mean they are doing less business or are
shying away from enron on concerns they won  t get paid  prudent
credit practices would dictate to any of these marketers that they
have to pay attention to what their exposure is to enron at any
given time   
there won  t be   any real short  term or long  term damage to
the franchise value of enron  s marketing and trading business as
long as everything gets fixed  and they get past this current
situation and have the opportunity to deal with their credit
quality in the long run  then there isn  t any long  term
implication or any real significant impact on their ability to
remain the market leader there   
  the credit extended to enron by its counterparties is
something that enron looks at day to day   
  we have no indication that   firms have stopped dealing
with enron  but if that happened    the situation could get
serious   
on the possibility of being downgraded to junk 
it is still a   fairly remote possibility   at this time that
enron could lose its investment grade credit rating  he said 
  they have plenty of liquidity in the short  term that will get
them through the current situation   
  there is a credible case to be made that   there are
actions management has   to take to restore the balance sheet to
investment  grade quality  management is both willing and able to
take the steps necessary to do that  there  s a really good chance
that if they can get through this period of uncertainty  they  ll
be able to accomplish that   
on off  balance sheet exposure 
  i don  t think anybody has a good handle on exactly what the
shortfall might be there on all those vehicles  part of the
company  s responsibility at this point is to make the case to
rating agencies and outside investors and to all interested
parties  to lay out the facts  give assurances that there aren  t
more surprises  that there is value in the assets there  and
should those assets fall short of the obligations  the willingness
to issue equity to make up that shortfall is there

enron fails to get funds from institutional investor  wsj says
         new york 
houston  oct    bloomberg    enron corp  tried to get
financing from at least one institutional investor and was turned
down  the wall street journal reported in its   heard on the
street   column  citing a person familiar with the situation 
enron was rejected because of uncertainties regarding its
finances  late yesterday  the company  s bankers were finishing
work on a new credit line of more than   billion  according to
people close to the discussions 
general electric co   s ge capital  berkshire hathaway inc 
and royal dutch petroleum co  are considered potential buyers for
at least part of enron  whose stock has fallen to   year lows and
is now trading at about book value  the paper said 
an enron spokesman wouldn  t comment on the possibility of a
takeover or whether the company had approached prospective
investors  the paper reported 
takeover talk can  t halt enron stock plunge

not even rumors of an impending buyout offer could stop the meltdown in enron common stock on tuesday 
enron shares fell     to close at      share tuesday in spite of reports that either bp  general electric  or royal dutch  shell was about to make a bid for the battered natural gas and power trading giant 
 i  ve heard all the rumors since enron stock was in trouble the last time four years ago  and i don  t put any credence in them   said carol coale  a natural gas analyst for prudential securities in houston   i would question why anyone would want to buy enron when we don  t know what the equity side of the balance sheet is  
coale predicted that the stock could fall to the       share range before stabilizing  that is the range she estimates for enron  s current book value  the worth it assigns to its assets  at the end of the second quarter  the book value was more than    share  she said 
the rumors apparently originated on various internet bulletin boards 
enron stock has fallen more than   since third  quarter financial results showing a   billion asset write  down  a   million net loss  and a     billion charge to equity were disclosed two weeks ago  od oct    pl   while various charges against earnings had been expected  the equity issue had not been revealed previously  investors and analysts were livid that enron had not honored its pledge to be more open and transparent about its financials 
the equity charge was related to the termination of two off  balance  sheet financing vehicles that had been headed by enron  s former chief financial officer  andrew s  fastow  at the same time he was a corporate officer  since then  investors have filed multiple lawsuits charging enron  s management with conflicts of interest and failure to perform fiduciary duties  fastow resigned last week  od oct    p   
another factor driving the stock down further was the us securities and exchange commission  s decision to transfer an informal inquiry into the fastow situation to washington  d  c   from houston  the agency has not changed the status of the matter to an investigation 
this week the company has been dealing with liquidity issues as it tries to arrange a new line of credit to augment the   billion it drew down from existing financial arrangements last week 
enron vice president mark palmer told oil daily that several parties in crude and refined products trading had asked enron to renegotiate credit terms  which the company will do  those commodities represent only about   of enron  s total trading book 
natural gas and electricity make up around   of the company  s business  and those products  are trading as usual   he said

copyright   dow jones it would be hard to devise a bill that consists mainly of corporate giveaways without giving a lot of money to the biggest companies  to understand what the bill is really about  you have to look at the big payoffs to not  so  big companies 
one piece of the bill is custom  designed to benefit a small group of multinational financial firms  another is clearly there for the sake of certain health insurors  but the most remarkable thing is how much of the benefit from repeal of the alternative minimum tax  a measure that is also included in the bush administration  s supposed stimulus plan  and which seems to be one of the administration  s key priorities  goes to companies that are not all that big 
for example  it  s not too surprising that calculations by citizens for tax justice show general motors  with its    workers  getting a check for   million  but it  s quite amazing that txu  formerly dallas power and light   a company with only    employees  would get a check for   million  and there are a number of medium  sized companies that  like txu  are in line for surprisingly big benefits  these companies include chevrontexaco  enron  phillips petroleum  imc global and cms energy  what do they have in common 
well  they tend to be in the energy or mining businesses  and they tend to be based in or near texas  in other words  the one  eyed bearded man with a limp looks a lot like dick cheney 
there is almost certainly a lot of overlap between the companies that would derive large benefits from alternative minimum tax repeal and those that would have received large subsidies under the energy plan devised by mr  cheney  s task force  you may remember that the administration  in apparent defiance of the law  refused to make the records of that task force  s meetings available to congress  that  s one of those issues that seems to have been dropped after sept   
and i guess it  s superfluous to point out that the big winners in all this seem to be companies that gave large  one  sided donations to the republican party in the last election   this is not to suggest that democrats are any less susceptible to the influence of money  
to me  the story of the bush administration is starting to look like the plot of  victor  victoria   first we had a candidate who was supposed to be a moderate  then we learned  or thought we learned  that this was a mask  he was really a hard  line conservative who pretended to be a moderate in order to gain office 
but the latest economic proposals from the administration  like the cheney energy plan  don  t look as if they came from serious free  marketeers  they don  t make sense in terms of either demand  side or supply  side economics  but they do give a lot of money to certain companies  so maybe ideology was just another mask for someone who was really the candidate of corporations  not corporations in general  but a small group of companies with a quite specific set of business interests  and who is only pretending to be a hard  line conservative who pretended to be a moderate in order to gain office 
it  s an interesting and all too plausible picture  but it  s a picture that most people will never see on their tv  and that many people would refuse to accept no matter how strong the evidence  that  of course  is what makes the whole thing possible  in the land of the blind  the one  eyed bearded man with a limp is king

when bubbles burst  glimpses into the inner workings of deals often follow  the internet bubble is proving no different 
at first glance  there doesn  t seem to be a lot in common between embattled online energy trader and broadband telecom wannabe enron corp  and the mevc draper fisher jurvetson i fund  a new york  listed closed  end venture capital fund 
yet enron and draper  fisher jurvetson not only epitomize a new  economy thinking that  s gone awry but a kind of insider excess that was characteristic of those now  departed go  go years 
enron  s shares have been falling since the markets began to recognize the dangers of its plans to shed real assets to try its hand at selling broadband capacity alongside its big online energy trading business  similarly  the mevc draper fisher jurvetson fund i  a retail fund that took the draper fisher name but that wasn  t run by the silicon valley vc  now trades at a   discount to its net asset value since its much  ballyhooed launch in  
enron thought the internet would revolutionize its business  and it did  by further commoditizing the energy products the company sold  dfj thought that venture capital itself could be commoditized and branded  and then peddled to retail investors eager to pan for internet gold dust 
neither strategy worked  both failed to account for the risk in a changing economic climate 
today  enron finds itself a huge player in online energy trading and a struggling startup in a battered telecom industry  strategic shifts that could well threaten its survival  the houston company is making the rounds with bankers trying to secure a lending line large enough to avoid yet another potentially crippling credit downgrade 
dfj engineered a truly top  of  the  bubble move into the vc  space   franchising the firm  s name to another band of vcs so that they could list a retail fund on the new york stock exchange  closed  end funds rarely succeed in the best of times  mixing vc and the closed  end fund formula just as the internet economy deflated proved even more problematic 
but while mevc  s investors are surely out of pocket  dfl itself is still pulling in handsome management fees  mevc advisers inc  and sub  adviser the draper fisher jurvetson mevc management co  earn a     advisory fee and   incentive fee from its franchisee  high fees paid to various advisers are hardly unknown in silicon valley  where institutional investors and pension funds know the risks and are willing to pay the price to play  but mevc draper fisher jurvetson fund i was always meant to go to retail investors  with the obligatory sec disclosures about risk and the fund  s fees buried high up in the prospectus  who are  presumably  not as sophisticated 
enron  of course  also chose to bury the cost of its dealings with its own executives in an sec filing  the hefty fees paid to enron executives to manage the risk of its new online trading strategy cost enron cfo andrew fastow his job last week

pge  s financial loss first in years

portland  ore   ap   saddled with surplus power  portland general electric posted a   million loss for the third quarter 
pge recorded a total of   million in sales  but that didn  t make up for high  priced electricity and an unpredictable wholesale market 
 fuel costs and purchased power really ate away at net income   said scott simms  a utility spokesman 
until recently  pge had benefited from a surge in wholesale electricity prices  which hit the west in the spring of   but earlier this year wholesale prices plummeted  electricity shortages eased and pge found itself with surplus power it no longer could sell for a gain 
pge officials say they can  t remember the last time the utility had recorded a quarterly loss 
a third  quarter jump in expenses clearly showed through in pge  s financial report  the utility spent a record   million for wholesale electricity and fuel  compared with   million for the year  ago period when energy shortages and skyrocketing power costs first began showing up in financial reports 
during the third quarter of   a time of relative stability for energy markets  pge spent   million for electricity and fuel 
pge owns power plants capable of meeting roughly half the demand of its    residential and business customers  it buys the rest of its electricity on wholesale markets 
a subsidiary of houston  based enron  the utility serves more oregon customers than any other utility  its territory covers most of the populous northern willamette valley 
pge attributed the recent steep drop in electric power prices to federal price controls  mild summer weather  added generation from new power plants  a fall in natural gas prices and conservation 
drought conditions  which forced pge to rely more heavily on natural gas  fired power plants rather than hydroelectric generation  further increased the utility  s costs  pge reported 
pge disclosed its third  quarter loss in a filing late last week with the securities and exchange commission  the utility will submit its full quarterly report in mid  november 
consistent gains pge had posted a steady stream of quarterly gains at least since   according to utility records 
large rate increases  effective oct    are expected to generate an additional   million annually and push earnings back into positive territory  utility officials say the extra revenue will be used almost entirely for electricity and fuel purchases 
several business and consumer groups have objected to the oct   increases and have asked the oregon public utility commission to re  evaluate the decision that put the new rates into effect 
regulators will decide by nov   whether to reconsider their decision 
portland  based northwest natural gas also is closely watching pge  s situation  nw natural on oct   announced plans to buy pge from enron for almost   billion in cash  stock and assumed debt

mumbai  energy analysts and anti  enron activists have criticised the reported move by indian financial institutions to buy out enron  s exposure to the tune of     billion at a  per cent discount 
a recent report suggested that a consortium of financial institutions led by the industrial development bank of india  which is also the lead banker for the project  was negotiating picking up enron  s exposure in the project at a  per cent discount 
the reported pay  out for enron  s stake in the dabhol power company is grossly in excess of what the madhav godbole committee had recommended 
contending that the offer was highly over  priced  convenor of the enron virodhi andolan  pradyumna kaul  said    enron  along with general electric and bechtel  has an equity stake of   million and a bridge loan of   million  which takes their total exposure to over   billion  the godbole committee had recommended in its renegotiation report a five  year moratorium on all loans and a discounting of enron  s equity to   million   
the state government had accepted this formula while the centre has talked in terms of paying   million    all these computations are much lower than the   million to   million that the financial institutions are willing to pay    he said 
mr kaul said an independent study commissioned by his ngo had suggested a formula much different from what enron is hoping to negotiate    out of the     billion project cost  the study says   billion can be written off  half of this capital cost restructuring would come from writing down equity   
to the argument that indian fis would lose out if they wrote off such huge amounts  he said    here  we are talking of writing off about rs        crore out of rs    crore  in the capital restructuring in the steel sector  amounts of about rs    crore were recently written off    he asserted 
abhay mehta  author of  power play   an expose of the enron deal  said    if the fis think they have evaluated enron  s stake fairly  it is a matter of grave concern   
an analyst with the prayas energy group  shantanu dixit  questions the validity of enron  s insistence that it should be paid even for its   development expenditure      it has factored in   million on this count  but this amount was spent before the project went online  how can that be clubbed with the project  s capital cost    he said 
  the fundamental issue is where did they spend this money  this claim is of a piece with enron executive linda powers  statement that the company spent   million on educating indians    mr dixit said 
it is learnt that idbi is not too happy with enron  s inclusion of   million as development expenditure and   million as earnings to be retained  in its tally of     billion 
  against this figure  the  per cent discount is notional    a source said    without these two add  ons  there is simply no discount    he pointed out 
another analyst who has followed enron closely says that by no stretch of imagination can development expenditure be so high    the big question here is how enron has managed to inflate its cost  the kirit parikh committee had claimed to have brought down the costs of the project from     billion to     billion  but enron overshot the original estimate of     billion by another   million  what is the explanation for this and why should financial institutions pay for it    he said 
a mantralaya official pointed out that a related issue was the future of the lng shipping company  greenfield  floated by enron to build a ship to supply fuel to dabhol  enron had a  per cent stake in it and the shipping corporation of india had a  per cent stake    it has refused to pay its   million equity in that venture    he said

said john gavin  president of plymouth  minnesota  based sec
insight  a private research company that obtained the letter
through the freedom of information act

enron chief of staff steve kean said the letter is from the sec  s
corporations and finance division  which he said regularly sends
questions to companies about the form and content of their
corporate filings 
  this is a quite common    kean said    i  m sure that if you
did freedom of information act requests for other large companies 
you would find similar letters with lengthy commentary    he said
  you can  t really make a connection   between the letter and the
current sec inquiry

usa  nymex plans to start otc natgas clearing services 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
new york  oct   reuters   the new york mercantile exchange  nymex  said on tuesday it plans to offer credit intermediation through clearing services and trading tools to the over  the  counter  otc  natural gas market 
the plan includes launching exchange of futures for swap  efs  transactions and large order executions to the natgas futures market within the next few weeks  adding to its previously announced electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts 
 recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the exchange  s plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under the umbrella of our clearinghouse   nymex president j  robert collins said in the statement 
a swap is an unregulated contractual agreement between two parties which involves a guaranteed fixed price on an underlying commodity for a set period of time that is later settled in cash 
traders said the nymex announcement was well  timed in light of credit concerns swirling in the gas market following enron  s recent stock plunge 
houston  based enron corp   the biggest u  s  natural gas and electricity trading house  saw its shares slump  percent tuesday to      their lowest level since  
nymex said   million will be available as a guarantee to participants on each of the exchange divisions through a fund backed by exchange clearing members  nearly eliminating credit risk between individual parties 
efs transactions  similar to exchange of futures for physical  efp  transactions  allow two parties to privately negotiate an integrated otc swap and related futures transaction priced according to their own mutual terms 
the transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side  of  market quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures contract 
efs transactions will be permitted to liquidate  initiate  and transfer futures market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction 
the clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notify nymex of the amount and type of futures contracts involved  the price at which the futures transaction should be cleared  and the identity of the parties involved 
nymex will also start letting traders execute block trades of  natural gas futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months at the best bid or offer for that size  these trades will not be permitted during the closing range 
the exchange said that early next year it will launch a cleared henry hub natural gas swaps contract  providing the marketplace with direct clearing on the most popular energy swaps contract over the last several year 
as part of this move  nymex said it will clear otc  executed transactions through its efs mechanism

 c  reuters limited  
houston  oct   reuters   shares of enron corp  dropped  percent to their lowest level since  on tuesday  amid fears of a credit crunch and persistent investor concerns over its silence about the energy giant  s finances 
the stock was the most active by far on the new york stock exchange as the biggest trader of natural gas and power in north america suffered another rout in its  th straight day of losses 
houston  based enron has shed more than   billion in market capitalization in the past two weeks amid a series of disclosures about murky off  balance  sheet deals with partnerships run by its then chief financial officer 
the disclosures destroyed the stock  forced the ouster of cfo andrew fastow  led to a u  s  securities and exchange commission conflict  of  interest inquiry and have caused at least one credit rating agency to slash enron  s senior  debt credit status 
enron stock closed down     to     in trading volume of    million shares  a good  percent more than the next most active stock on the nyse 
the shares crossed the   threshold in the morning for the first time since january   then repeatedly tested the   barrier throughout the session before touching a low of     shortly before the close  its lowest level since july  
 this enron situation is unique  and uniquely bad  the inability of the management to make a satisfactory response to all these claims and innuendoes has caused a mighty run on the stock for these past few weeks   said sanders morris harris analyst john olson 
 i for one am at a loss to explain their reticence to respond  
enron said it was working to address its credibility gap 
 we have heard the criticism loud and clear and we have made a commitment to change those perceptions   chairman and chief executive officer  ken lay and everyone else on this management team has made it their priority to bring investor confidence up to the strong level of our core business   enron spokesman vance meyer said 
focusing on near  term
one analyst suggested that enron was focusing management firepower on clearing the sec inquiry and securing new credit lines from its banks to address the concerns of the credit rating agencies 
 they  re focused on those two things  and i think if they successfully do those things they will find they will not be downgraded below investment grade   commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said 
if enron  s credit drops below investment grade at current stock levels  it would be forced to issue more shares and further dilute the stock  worse  meade said  it would drastically increase enron  s cost for trading  as counterparties demand more cash and guarantees for deals 
olson said the stock price was irrationally low  even assuming a conservative valuation of enron  s businesses at  times estimated  earnings per share of     
the company  s core trading business is worth about   per share at those levels  olson said  the total company  even accounting for losses from the failing broadband business  is worth about   now as opposed to   two weeks ago  he said 
after cutting enron  s rating on monday  moody  s investors service warned it could lower the rating even further  as well as cut enron  s short  term debt status  the cut coincided with enron  s confirmation that it was seeking additional credit lines to increase its liquidity  after tapping its full     billion revolving credit line last week 
enron has seen its credibility demolished as it has given piecemeal answers about its involvement in financial partnerships so complex as to confound even seasoned financial analysts who make their living unraveling earnings statements and balance sheets 
fastow was general partner in two partnerships  which paid him millions in management fees  that did business with enron  they caused a     billion loss in shareholder equity after enron was forced to repay the partnerships with stock once their investments  many into broadband  soured

enron  s stock continues tumbling after investigation reportedly moves to washington
    
associated press newswires
copyright   the associated press  all rights reserved 
houston  ap   enron corp   s stock plummeted to a nine  year low on tuesday  pushed down in part by reports that an investigation by the securities and exchange commission moved to the agency  s headquarters in washington from a regional office in fort worth  texas 
shares of enron  the nation  s largest natural gas and power marketer  fell      or by  percent  to      a level not seen since  
enron  s stock price decline steadily from nearly   at the beginning until the middle of october  when the company reported earnings and serious questions about its fiscal health were raised 
since reporting a disappointing quarterly losses on oct    enron has been negotiating with banks to establish new credit lines and has been surrounded by turmoil because of losses stemming from partnerships managed by the company  s former chief financial officer 
the partnerships have raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the sec 
the wall street journal reported tuesday the sec investigation has been moved to the agency  s washington office 
analysts say the change was interpreted to mean the investigation is more serious than originally thought 
 i would imagine that  the falling stock price  must be attributed to the sec shift in venue  that is today  s goblin  with enron  s stock price  said robert christensen  an analyst with fac  equities in new york 
enron officials did not immediately return messages left tuesday by the associated press  sec spokesman michael robinson declined comment and would not confirm or deny the investigation had been moved 
shares of enron were sacked by more than  percent on monday after moody  s investors service downgraded the company  s long  term debt and warned of possible further downgrades 
enron reported a net loss of   million in the third quarter  taking a one  time charge of     billion attributed to investment losses  troubled assets and unit restructurings 
enron  s stock has dropped ever since as it became apparent some of those losses were tied to partnerships managed by enron  s former chief financial officer  andrew fastow  who was ousted last week 
the company last week decided to cash in about   billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence 
christensen said it  s premature to discuss any possibility that enron could be taken over if its current financial woes don  t improve 
 a vote of confidence by an outside financial institution  a commercial bank or two extending them additional credit and or a white knight investor stating that they have reviewed the basic book of business of this company and that it  s ok would work wonders   christensen said 
christensen said enron  s core business model of energy marketing is a very good one 
 the sidelines and hobbies enron was attracted to in the last five years have come home to roost but its basic business function appears to be valid   he said 
christensen said other energy companies  whose stock prices have suffered because of the enron tumult  do not appear to be hurt by what has been happening to enron recently
