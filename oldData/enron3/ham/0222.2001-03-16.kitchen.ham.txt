we executed final documentation on sale of the noram rig for   million      million net to enron   although the purchaser has until april  th to fund  there are no contingencies in the contract and scf partners controls the entity  the delay in funding is required since there is a   day period for them to make their capital calls 
a number of things came together for us this week  which is good 
the week is now over

today we negotiated a handshake agreement with smith properties to buy out jedi  s position in inland for   million    million net to enron   the dash minimum was     million      net to enron   the original offer  documentation will be simple  our rep is limited to we own it and we can sell it  expect to close and fund next week 
given the inland situation and the absence of any foreseeable payment on our preferred  i view this outcome as very favorable 
brandi morris  work on this transaction was outstanding
