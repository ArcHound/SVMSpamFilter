new york  oct   reuters   energy and mining companies have provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third  quarter results on monday and tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in  years 
technology bellwethers intel corp  and international business machines corp   which reported sharply lower profits  did little to buck the downward trend 
firstenergy corp   an owner of electric utilities in northern ohio and western pennsylvania  on tuesday reported a better  than  expected  percent increase in earnings  citing increased electricity sales and lower costs  mining company freeport  mcmoran copper  gold inc  reported a third  quarter profit that reversed a year  earlier loss  due to higher gold production 
yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule  top chipmaker intel said on tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled  percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales  pc maker ibm announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of  as weak sales continued to weigh on profits 
energy giant enron corp  posted a quarterly loss after taking     billion in charges  companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls  including caterpillar inc   the world  s largest maker of construction equipment  and unisys corp   a computer company 
 the earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly  and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point   said michael holland  who runs the   million holland balanced fund 
focus not on earnings
 the focus  for investors  has been and continues to be outside of earnings  that is  the war on terrorism specifically   he said 
dynegy inc   a natural gas and power marketer and trader  on monday said third  quarter earnings rose  percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns  while enron posted a loss  it reported that its profit excluding charges rose  percent due to strong performance in its core energy business 
 energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down   said jon burnham  portfolio manager for the   million burnham fund   these are good  well  financed companies  
caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes  the peoria  illinois  based company on tuesday said its third  quarter earnings fell  percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing 
the company also said it expects fourth  quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year  ago quarter  with full  year profit down  percent to  percent  it blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month  s attacks for the expected shortfall  but added that  sales will be at least flat to up slightly from  levels 
unisys on monday reported its third  quarter profits plunged by  percent due to weakening demand for high  end server computers and systems integration work  it said it would cut    jobs and slashed its fourth  quarter outlook 
taking grim tidings in stride
other companies that have reported profit drops include novellus systems inc   a maker of semiconductor production equipment  and charles schwab corp   the top u  s  discount brokerage  schwab said tuesday that quarterly earnings fell  percent as customers avoided stocks all summer  although a surge in september trading pointed to better times ahead 
money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride 
 most of these earnings situations are in these stocks   said burnham   barring unforeseens in the national and international situation  the market should work its way higher over the next  to  months  
 whatever earnings are in this quarter isn  t going to matter too much  except in cases where they  re considerably better than expected or worse   he said 
this week is the busiest for earnings with  dow jones industrial average and  standard  poor  s  index companies scheduled to report 
profits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by    percent  according to market research firm first call  thomson financial  making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of   that  s down from an expected    percent decline at the beginning of the quarter  and a    percent drop expected on sept    said first call analyst joe cooper

usa  interview  enron says may partner or sell broadband business

houston  oct   reuters   energy giant enron corp  said on tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss  making broadband telecommunications business  which could involve selling the business or finding a partner 
 in addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business  we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities   chief executive officer ken lay told reuters in a telephone interview 
earlier on tuesday  enron reported that one  time charges of     billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third  quarter net loss of   million  its first quarterly loss in more than four years 
future options for the broadband business include  sale  partnership  all kinds of possibilities  he said 
 we still think over time that it will be a valuable business   lay said  but for now the broadband market is in a  total meltdown   he added 
enron  s broadband unit  which owns an    mile network  posted a loss of   million for the third quarter  but lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters 
enron launched its broadband business last year  predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity  but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market  s early potential and has scaled down its operations 
enron  s stock rose by  percent last year  driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform 
but the stock has fallen some  percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured  ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over enron  s stalled dabhol power plan project in india

washington  oct   reuters   enron corp  on tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking     billion in charges on ill  fated investments  including water and telecommunications services  which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses 
enron  north america  s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power  said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company  s stock lost two  thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company 
 what we  ve tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way   chief executive officer ken lay said in a conference call 
lay reassumed the ceo mantle at enron after his successor  jeff skilling  resigned in august after only six months at the helm 
houston  based enron reported a third  quarter net loss of   million  or  cents a share  compared with net income of   million  or  cents a share  in the same period of   it was enron  s first loss since the second quarter of  
the charges covered the company  s loss  making broadband telecommunications business  its troubled water affiliate azurix  and new power co   enron  s retail electricity joint  venture with aol  time warner and ibm 
commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said it would probably take enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a wall street favorite just  months ago 
 they do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting  they  re a solid company  but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield   said meade 
enron  s stock closed  cents higher at     on tuesday  but for the year it is down about  percent  underperforming the standard  poor  s utilities index  spu   which has fallen some  percent over the same period 
ill  fated businesses
originally a natural gas pipeline operator  enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of u  s  energy markets to become the nation  s dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity 
the company moved into the water services business in  by acquiring britain  s wessex water and forming azurix  a unit which enron took public in  but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled 
enron helped set up new power co  and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about   per share to less than   as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated u  s  residential electricity markets 
enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year  predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity  but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market  s early potential 
enron  s stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of  percent  driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform 
but the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured  skilling resigned and wrangling continued over enron  s stalled dabhol power plan project in india 
enron  s third  quarter earnings before one  time charges rose to   million  or  cents a share  from   million  or  cents a share  meeting analysts  expectations of  to  cents a share  according to thomson financial  first call 
the company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of  cents a share for the fourth quarter      for all of  and     for all of  
debt on credit review
rating agency moody  s investors service on tuesday said it had placed all of enron  s long  term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade  the writedowns would reduce enron  s equity base  increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings  moody  s said 
enron  s third  quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division  the company  s backbone moneymaker  grew  percent 
the division  which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas  saw pretax income rise to   million from   million in the third quarter of  
all of the income growth in the segment came from enron  s gas and power trading and marketing operations in the americas  where income grew to   million from   million last year 
the european segment  which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals  coal and crude oil  remained flat at   million amid lower volatility 
the latest earnings report marked the first time that enron has provided a financial breakdown of the european and americas wholesale operations 
in doing so  lay delivered on a promise he made after skilling  s departure  that he would make enron  s financial reporting more transparent  many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from enron

enron has third  quarter loss after expansion fails  update  
 adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to  percent
of enron  s profits over the last four quarters  closes shares  
houston  oct    bloomberg    enron corp   the largest
energy trader  had a   million loss in the third quarter after
expansion into water  telecommunications and retail  energy sales
cost the company     billion 
the loss was  cents a share after payment of preferred
dividends  enron said  net income a year earlier was   million 
or  cents  revenue rose  percent to     billion 
investors have sent enron stock down  percent this year on
concern about investments outside energy trading and natural  gas
pipelines  some investors praised kenneth lay  enron  s chairman
and chief executive officer  for acknowledging the failure of the
new businesses  others said they  re not confident all the bad news
is out 
  what is disconcerting is that they didn  t do this sooner   
said donald coxe  manager of the   million harris insight
equity fund    if you kill one cockroach in the kitchen  it
doesn  t mean there aren  t more   
investors have questioned enron  s financial reporting in the
past year  especially after jeffrey skilling  s resignation as ceo
in august  skilling  who helped lay transform enron from a gas 
pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading  said
he left for personal reasons  investors said they weren  t
confident enron was detailing all its problems 
failed businesses
the     billion in losses  which total     a share  are
equal to  percent of enron  s     billion in profits over the
past four quarters 
included were   million for losses on investments in new
power co   a venture formed with aol time warner inc  and
international business machines corp  new power competes for
energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and
gas suppliers as they do long  distance phone companies 
the   million also includes losses from the enron unit
that trades space  known as bandwidth  on fiber  optic networks  as
well as for the   early termination of certain structured finance
arrangements   with an undisclosed   entity    enron wouldn  t be
more specific 
enron said restructuring the fiber  optic unit would cost
another   million  including severance pay to  fired
workers  the business collapsed this year along with the fortunes
of the dot  com companies that were expected to be some off its
biggest customers 
the declining value of assets owned by azurix corp   its
water and sewage treatment business  will cost   million  enron
said 
enron might take a first  quarter   adjustment   of less than
  million because of accounting changes related to goodwill 
lay said in an interview    if we thought there were any other
significant concerns  we would have taken care of them today   
lay said 
excluding losses
minus the losses  enron would have earned   million  or 
cents a share  up  percent from the year  earlier period  that
matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson
financial  first call 
enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of  percent
for the past year  its wholesale services business  which includes
energy trading  had income before interest  minority interests and
taxes of   million  up  percent from a year earlier 
shares of enron rose  cents to      earlier  the stock
had risen as much as    percent to     
  there  s a sigh of relief that enron  s core businesses  its
energy merchant businesses  are ok    said roger hamilton  who
helps manage john hancock  s value funds  which own    shares 
enron said it still expects to earn  cents a share in the
fourth quarter      for the full year and     in  
 ridiculous investments 
at one time  enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that
contributed to the     billion in losses 
enron spent     billion in  for the u  k   s wessex water 
from which azurix emerged  enron sold shares to the public in
  and then bought back the company this year after azurix
failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning
large projects  in august  enron agreed to sell azurix  s north
american business to american water works inc  for   million 
in february   lay said trading bandwidth could become the
company  s fastest  growing business  in the latest quarter  the
bandwidth unit  s loss before interest  minority interests and
taxes widened to   million from   million a year earlier 
revenue plunged to   million from   million 
  you can make the case that jeff skilling leaving was for
the best    john hancock  s hamilton said    under him  they built
the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous
investments   
while admitting its poor choices  enron also supplied more
information this quarter about how it makes money  the company
gave results of individual commodity  trading desks  including
coal  forest products and steel 
  i liked that they broke out the different commodities   
hamilton said    i think lay has gotten the message loud and
clear  and that the effort is there
