las vegas 
allegheny  s bid was strong but required a financing out for  days  unacceptable  black hills  bid has a clean purchase and sale markup with a bid that implies a   mm gain for ena    mm has to go to calpers since they are an investor in lv    they are going to their board thursday and want to execute by early next week and close aug   we will try to get a higher bid from northland this week    mm gain   they will require a two  week financing out which they will secure with a   mm non  refundable deposit  if we sign with northland  they can close in july 
in either case  accounting may require us to recognize this income this quarter because las vegas is a fair market value investment  rac requires a dash to sell an asset of this size  we will circulate on wednesday or thursday 
one long shot deal we are proposing to allegheny  tear up the existing  year toll backed by the las vegas project  enter into a  year firm energy sale from epmi at palo verde  the value of that deal may be in excess of   mm since the market has fallen so much  if we did that  we would have a merchant asset that would have to be sold at or near cost  this is achievable  this would be significantly riskier than our current plan and would probably require board approval  but the value makes it worth exploring 
amps 
we continue to push geneva steel and oregon steel for permitting info  west power markets have fallen further so the economics are marginal at best  friday  s curves suggested a value of   mm vs a cost of   mm  an imperfect put swaption would cost   mm  further eroding the value  i spoke to brett wiggs on friday and forwarded him technical specs and reviewed different deal structures that might work 
dwr 
they announced thursday that they have signed more definitive long term deals that they will honor  approx    mw long term   the non  binding  agreements in principle  will be renegotiated because prices have fallen so much  dwr signed our master agreement for short term deals but tim does not want to execute it because of litigation risk  we will not do anything with them at this time 
generator tolls  interest has fallen off due to rapid drop in power prices  we are still talking with    parties  but i dont think anything will get done soon 
munis  mcdonald got a small term sale done at np   with city of lassen  approx   k of orig 
new marketing initiatives 
negotiating  generator service agreements  mostly small plants coming on line this year  the entrepreneurs behind these deals are shell shocked by the low prices  but many have already committed capital 
montana   state forced divestiture of generation  retail load is short starting july     governor  s office has asked us to bring a  mw  year  solution   they are willing to issue a   mm bond to prepay and buydown part of the energy  the basic play is to swap an epmi mid  c position for an in  state position from ppl  package that up with some renewables and sell to the state under a prepaid ppa  long shot but interesting 
ca industrials  a group of industrials want to buy up to  mw np   delivered for   years as part of a negotiated settlement with ca  gov affairs is working on a core  non  core structure with the state that would potentially lead to open access for all industrial load if they pay a big exit fee to cover the stranded costs incurred during the past  months
