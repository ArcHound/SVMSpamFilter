ferc price cap order client conference call

host  ray niles
late last night the federal energy regulatory commission   ferc   acted to
impose  temporary  wholesale power price caps in the western united states 
 the cap affects the  real  time  market  which we estimate is only  
of the total wholesale market  it is set to expire in one year
from may 
 this is a near  term negative for power producers and energy
merchants  a dramatic example of  headline risk   the political risk of
re  regulation has stepped up  in our view  reducing the multiple investors
will pay for earnings
 in terms of earnings  ironically  the effect may be somewhat
positive  albeit small  only   of market is affected   caps are likely to
increase volatility  benefitting energy merchants  and sustain high power
prices for a longer period of time  benefitting power producers  by reducing
the incentive to build new plants
