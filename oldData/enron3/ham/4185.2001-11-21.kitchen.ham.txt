  the best split is probably just    on personnel  while everyone is in a specific box on the org chart  many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles  the  on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward  for example  if ees wants something specific on a state puc matter  
  in terms of approving outside service expenditures  i would like to sit down with you  louise  and rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals  i will try and set up some time the first week of december 
  i have put steve montovano in the ne gas box  this will increase the budget by   k  based on historical figures   i have attached a new org chart to represent this change 
also  dan staines  who is not on the org chart  has an employment contract that ends       dan has been working on florida and northeast rto matters and continues to help east power with the nyiso tcc auction  we can sever him  but his contract will need to be paid off    k   govt affairs also has a contract for support with joe connor  ex  southern exec  to support our se activities  i am trying to get a copy of the contract  but i think that it is in place until     my recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today 
thanks 
jim

ees is fine with the org  chart below  i understand the     million is total for both ena  ees  comments 
   need a recommended split of the     million for ena  ees 
   i understand the     million includes   for outside services  the ooc of ena  ees needs to approve as these services are needed 
   the     million does include legacy real estate costs  jim fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs  is this on his radar screen 
   we need to reconcile what we do with steve montovano  because both ena  ees want to utilize him  i might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him  louise  jim  are you both ok with this  if so  rick  jim  i would suggest putting him in the ne gas box 
   rick  i understand you  re talking with kean  whalley on handling the washington office activity in corp  i agree

here is the org chart that captures our discussions  i think that this org and the  of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ena and ees 
total headcount    the personnel cost      mm  total for ena and ees  
please let me know if you have any questions
