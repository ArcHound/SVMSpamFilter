Subject  ea budget with enw
budget update  suggestions 
piper  richter  and webb met with whalley this saturday for a few hours on overall enrononline strategy and budget  we showed him the development completed to date and the general development list going forward  we also showed him the down time report as well as some growth numbers over the last  months  we also explained a few of the commercial objectives going forward  finally  we showed him the same suggested eol budget plan we showed you  including  plan vs   forecast vs   plan as well as the allocation methodology  greg is generally ok with the total  plan number for eol      million fully loaded with bonus  indirects and depreciation   why we want that money and where it would be spent  what he did not like was the allocation methodology  which is currently cost based and based on development and products  he suggested a charge that included a fixed fee plus a product setup fee plus a product maintenance fee plus a per transaction charge  etc  richter and webb are researching that and will try to see if it will work  i think you and i can agree the     million is good for  but we still need to agree on your part for ea  the current cost based suggestion for ea for eol for  is about   million  a question is  will you and lavo accept any charges for  for eol based on transactions  sheriff also has the entire eol suggested budget and his part  we meet eim and egm today on their total enw charges 
on operations  the current suggested  ea charge is     million  which is also a fully loaded number and is slightly down from  forecast  sally and bob and i can explain that in detail this week   what i would like to do is agree between you and i that you will accept that as eas budget number for  plan for operations  what we still need to work on is how we would possibly bill that in some fixed and variable form that includes transaction counts 
on infrastructure  the current suggested ea plan number for      million  this is down from  forecast  this does not include the     million of controllable expense you budget directly for ea  the issue left here is what is eas headcount  what is the headcount in it development and what is the server infrastructure charge related to it development that would effect the ea number  on the first issue  we have the ea headcount as represented by hr  the current ea infrastructure charge assumes that complete number  it is larger than the number you have  you have requested we deal with some of that additional headcount differently since ea can  t bill out those on a fully loaded basis  we will work with wes and his team on that today and tomorrow to come up with a plan 
on it development  the current suggested  plan expense number for ea  fully loaded  is      million vs  a  forecast of     million  also  the  suggested capital number for ea is     million vs  a  forecast capital number of   million  the question is  what did you get for your     million in  and what would you get for     million in   first  mark and sally and i met on sunday and we want the  plan numbers to be down from  forecast  what we need to do in the next three days is finalize what are the critical maintenance and new development projects for  for ea  our team is bob hall  mark pickering  mark will call on stock and perlman and rao and hotte as he sees necessary  and greg piper with pickering having the final say for enw  can you tell me who you want from your side  story  belden   to work with us three over the next few days until we agree  we want to work on it around the clock until it is at least approximately right
