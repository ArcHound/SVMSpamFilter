Subject re  netco hr team
i think it is a mistake but if we need to hit a number it is doable  if amy can provide the support by always having a line of communication open and visiting portland every few weeks

on reflection  when i sent you my hr team list yesterday  i made decision in order to get within   i would cover portland and calgary hr from houston  before we proceed on the basis of that team i need chris and tim to agree they are ok with this  milnthorp says he  s happy  so long as estate or our new parent provides payroll and benefits services  which i believe they will  
i would be happy to keep julie kearney on my list but i really don  t know if i can drop one of the others which would obviously push my team to  overall  this is down from  or   depending on which list you look at
