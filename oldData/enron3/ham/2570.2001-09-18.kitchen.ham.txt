steve sent you a breifing on the vitro plant  in case the topic it comes up 
the following is a brief bullet point description of the monterrey cogeneration plant to incorporate intom the information you are send louise in preparation for the conference tomorrow 
  mw cogeneration facility located in garcia  nuevo leon  about  miles west of monterrey  
 natural gas fired ge  fa gas turbine is the anchor piece of equipment used at the facility 
 commercial operations set for october    
 power purchasers are vitro   mw   imsa   mw   and apasco   mw  under  year ppas 
 vitro subsidiary alcali to be supplied  tons per hour of steam under a  year spa 
 transmission and distribution of the electricity to be provided by the cfe 
 natural gas to be provided by pgpb  pemex  
 financing provided by the inter  american development bank 
 major equipment foundations have been completed at the construction site  and equipment is beginning to be placed on the foundations 
 the offtakers of energy from this plant are expected to save over us   mm over the term of the  year agreements
a couple of other things to note are to the extent the project comes up  all enron people should refer to the project as the monterrey cogeneration plant and not the vitro plant so as not to diminish imsa and apasco  and to the extent we are questioned on the sell  down of the equity the response there is that initiative  while not finalized  is being pursued to manage enron  s balance sheet and that enron will continue to maintain a significant equity interest in the facility
