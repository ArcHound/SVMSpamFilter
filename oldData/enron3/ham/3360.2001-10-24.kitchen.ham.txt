stockwatch enron falls  pct on worries deals with ljm will impact earnings
    
afx news
 c   by afp  extel news ltd
new york  afx   shares of enron corp were sharply lower in afternoon trade  falling over  pct  as investors sold the stock a third day running on concerns that financial transactions made with related party ljm could negatively impact future earnings  dealers said 
at    pm  enron was down    usd  or    pct  at    
the djia was up    points at       and the s  p  composite index was up    at       while the nasdaq composite fell    to      
the company confirmed yesterday that the securities and exchange commission requested the company to provide information on certain related  party transactions 
many analysts responded by cutting the shares ratings on concerns that dealings with the related ljm partnership could affect future earnings  after two class actions were filed against the company yesterday 
the two lawsuits claim that enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not credit worthy 
the company  s operating results were also  materially overstated as result of the company failure to timely write down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships  managed by the company  s cfo 
the suit additionally alleged that enron failed to write down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with gaap  generally accepted accounting principles  
in its third  quarter results last week  enron announced a charge of    bln usd  or    usd per share  and an incremental    bln usd reduction in stockholders  equity  related to the unwinding of investments with the ljm partnerships 
jp morgan analyst anatol feygin said he has downgraded the stock to a  long  term buy  from a  buy  in  the wake of lingering concerns regarding the company  s credit situation and management disclosure of liabilities stemming from off  balance sheet financing vehicles  
the stock has been removed from jp morgan  s  focus list  
feygin also said that  management  s conference call yesterday morning was a missed opportunity to disclose the necessary information to assuage investor concerns  
goldman sachs analyst  david fleischer also agreed that enron  s disclosure was  modest  and  management did not resolve concerns  
however  credit concerns and questions about potential liabilities are  very much exaggerated   he said
 the real issue will turn out to be huge debt that enron was placing in these entities  
the shares  value have fallen by more than  pct since enron reported charges related to investments with ljm last week  but fleischer said he sees no recovery until management fully answers investor questions and restores credibility  an outcome he expects in future weeks

new york  oct   reuters   shares of enron corp  plunged further in midday trade on wednesday  hugging the top spot on the list of biggest losers on the new york stock exchange  on concerns whether financial deals made by north america  s largest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas could negatively affect earnings going ahead 
shares were trading down    percent  or      to     in midday trade  capping over a  percent decline this year in share price  as of tuesday  the company has lost more than   billion in value in the past week 
some analysts cut ratings or expressed concerns about the former high flyer  s lack of forthrightness in discussing business deals  unimpressed by management  s attempts on tuesday to pacify investor concerns about transactions involving enron  its chief financial officer  and two limited partnerships  all of which are being looked into by the securities and exchange commission  sec  
enron on tuesday rejected suggestions the transactions were a conflict of interest  saying the deals were disclosed in sec filings and approved by its board and internal and external auditors 
enron  which reported a loss and a     billion in charges for bad investments in the third  quarter  failed to mention a     billion reduction in shareholder value  and was less than forthcoming during a call with analysts and investors the next day

christine romans  cnnfn anchor  market call  now  joining us by phone to talk about his move on enron  url  http     www  enron  com   is anatol feygin  energy analyst at jp morgan  thank you for joining us 
anatol feygin  jp morgan  thanks for having me 
romans  ok  enron  last week  these shares lost some  or  percent of their value  continued to fall yesterday  and monday  what  s going on here why you  re downgrade  how concerned are you about in visibility management in the issues that we  re talking about here 
feygin  well  extremely concerned and until thursday of last week  i felt that a lot the information coming out was old news and was not critical to the fundamentals of the company  on friday of last week the credit market started to really get jittery and spreads on enron  s credit started to blow out and that could threaten the fundamental business  yesterday management had a opportunity to set the record straight on a conference call  i think that was a big opportunity missed  and until management comes out and reassures the credit markets  primarily  and then the equities markets  there is risk to the fundamental business which i still consider to be the premiere energy marketing and trading franchise that  s functioning well today  but it at risk because of credit issues 
barry hyman  ehrenkrantz king nussbaum  anatol  what exactly are these off balance sheets financing vehicle  that is of concern here  that management been reluctant to talk about 
feygin  there are two transaction still left  one called marlin and one called white wing or osprey  in marlin  it  s basically a    ownership of a u  k water utility that enron acquired in the october of    part of that taken public and    that was bought back in by enron this year  and problem is that entity  the assets of zurichs  which has this wessex water business in the u  k   are not enough to payoff the creditors in marlin  so  enron is on the hook for a portion of the equity that has back stopped this investment by marlin  and we estimate that to be in the hundreds of millions not in the billion dollar range  which i think the market fears 
white wing is a very similar structure  less transparent because that  s a collection of assets  things like  roughly half of enron  s investment in brazil  its european power plants and et cetera and it  s difficult to reconcile of what value of those asset is  and there is a possibly that enron have issue up to    billion in equity to make whole the investors in white wing 
romans  ok  anatol feygin  jp morgan  thank you very much  lots of other analysts saying that the conference call with the company didn  t really clear up some of the questions they had 
copyright   dow jones france telecom was unchanged from tuesday at    bps  and deutsche telecom was down about  bps at    bps  traders added  vodafone was quoted two basis points lower from late tuesday at    bps  with telefonica put at    bps in five  year default swaps  about five basis points lower 
stronger equity prices helped alleviate some concerns about the telecom sector  s financial health  although problems remain for many firms labouring under heavy debt burdens  a dealer for a european bank said 
he added that some default swap selling pressure was coming from players arranging synthetic portfolio products such as collateralised debt obligations  cdos  before the end of the year  cdos are portfolios of bonds and other debt obligations  the arranger issues bonds  secured by the underlying assets to fund the deal  in a synthetic cdo  the arranger sells default swaps on groups of debt in one hit to mimic the asset pool

enron may need several hundred mln usd to meet shortfalls at investment units
    
afx news
 c   by afp  extel news ltd
london  afx   enron corp might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more in the next  months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created  the wall street journal reported  citing an interview with enron treasurer ben glisan 
covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional enron shares  diluting the position of current shareholders  the paper said 
however  glisan said the company believes it can repay about    bln usd in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock 
the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities   known as the marlin water trust ii  the marlin water capital corp ii  the osprey trust and osprey i inc  the notes are coming due during the next  months 
glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes  also  enron is selling other assets  proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes  which ultimately are guaranteed by enron 
he said it appears that asset sales will raise at least    bln usd by the end of next year  this amount includes cash proceeds of    bln usd from the previously announced sale of enron  s portland general electric utility unit 
 there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds  to repay the notes  glisan was quoted as saying   but if we are wrong  we will issue equity  
glisan said a worst  case scenario would involve issuing as much as  bln usd in stock  enron said it has about  mln shares outstanding 
making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in enron  s share price  during the past week  shares of the energy  trading giant have dropped more than  pct

copyright   dow jones anything more than   is considered ultra  high risk  so while you can make    that  s still not enough  where the accounting is questionable   one bond trader says   you  re not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default  you have to worry about your recovery value  
not the kind of risk  reward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about     billion with a capital b 
speaking of bonds and stocks  even with its stock at about      global crossing  gx  nyse  news  commentary  still has a market cap that exceeds   billion  but while its stock has rallied  its bank debt has stayed relatively flat at around  cents to  cents on the dollar  similar stories can be told for xo communications  xoxo  nasdaq  news  commentary   with a market cap of about   million and bank debt trading at around  cents on the dollar  level  communications  lvlt  nasdaq  news  commentary   with a market cap of     billion and bank debt trading at  cents  and mcleodusa  mcld  nasdaq  news  commentary   with a market cap of   million and debt that trades at  cents 
where are opportunistic bond investors  who should be hopping on such cheap debt   especially bank debt  which is at the top of the getting  paid  back food chain  they  re nowhere to be seen  for the same reasons they  re not jumping to buy enron  s bonds  too much risk  because when companies like those go bad  their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading   try telling that to  hope  springs  eternal  stock investors

accounting irregularities  sell  those three words and an equals sign have always served me well  they remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine  always in view  they have never let me down  when i have deviated from them i have had to pay severely  as i did when i ignored the accounting irregularities in cendant  cd  nyse  news  commentary  initially or when  because of my four  month holding period  i couldn  t sell qwest  q  nyse  news  commentary  
which is why i came in with guns blazing on this enron  ene  nyse  news  commentary   telling you to sell it  the stock has now lost half its value and all i can say is  i still can  t see why you have to tempt fate and own this one  the notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound  that it has a great core business  is just hokum  who the heck knows  who has any idea of what this company can really earn  who knows what it did earn 
all i know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the democrats that the justice department is playing political favorites by not pursuing enron  noted republican  giving company  for alleged fraud 
when that happens  when that shoe drops  wherever enron is  then maybe it is worth some scrutiny 
but i bet i still won  t like it

if you disclose something that is wrong  and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed  and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed  is it therefore right 
that  s what enron  ene  nyse  news  commentary  is asking us to believe  by telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals  they have simply compounded the error  next they will tell us that janus  the largest shareholder  knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises 
what they are doing at enron is  well  positively   here we go     s  in the   s  you had all of these savings  and  loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery  somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher 
nope 
what it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble  the government ended up going after them  too  for abetting the travesties 
enron didn  t use taxpayers  money  so it is arguably not as clear  cut  but the more we probe this enron  the more we check it out  the more we know it really stinks and that jeffrey skilling didn  t leave because the stock got hammered  or some other authentic wall street gibberish  but because of this nasty  unseemly situation 
we don  t want an sec probe here  we want a justice department probe  this isn  t about unclear disclosure  this could end up being about fraud 
in the meantime  i wouldn  t touch this stock with a   foot pole  this one  s gonna get real nasty before it gets nice  if it ever does

enron  s disdain for investors
the motley fool  com
    
while recent coverage of enron centers on the cfo  s past partnerships  a smaller   and more obvious   omission is what should really make individual investors turn the heat up on this company  not only does it not release its cash flow statement during each quarter  s conference call and press release  something we don  t like but is prevalent  it also doesn  t release its balance sheet  the company must think we  re idiots  they  re wrong 
by tom jacobs   tmf tom  
october   
enron  s  nyse  ene   troubles just don  t stop  on monday  the company announced  that the securities and exchange commission  sec  had requested information on  certain related party transactions    that was a veiled reference to partnerships until recently organized and directed by enron cfo andrew fastow  there has been a flurry   a hailstorm   of financial media attention to this  there are only three possibilities  and none is palatable 
the company  s board allowed this deal in order to   using corporate speak    incentivize  the cfo  and it was not legal 
it was legal  but unethical  or
enron has been less than forthcoming  perpetuating a pattern of disdain for investors and keeping them in the dark 
the accounting machinations involve mind  numbing terms and obfuscation  making a simple explanation of what is being alleged above my capacity to provide  the new york times  floyd norris calls them  some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen   that leads me to one conclusion when i think about burying myself with the company  s sec filings  accounting texts  my high  speed web connection  and some beer  that of shakespeare  s king lear    that way madness lies  
on the one hand  i know that pulling all this apart might teach me useful things about accounting  reading financial statements  and finding trouble   to read what this is all about  check the  certain transactions  section of the company  s latest proxy statement    i fully intend to do that   someday  for now  though  all i need to know about enron as an investment is that the company has not made these issues transparent 
what  s worse  though  is that enron has made it a habit to keep investors in the dark  and not only about the potentially troublesome cfo issue  the company goes out of its way to hide its true financials  that really cheeses me off 
the quarterly call and press release parade
most companies hold quarterly conference calls and simultaneously spew press releases  for which the companies pay good money to business wire and pr newswire for dissemination  that allegedly state their latest quarter  s numbers and talk about the business  sometimes  when they have cleaned off their glasses enough for visibility and run it by their lawyers  execs will even venture to speak about the business climate ahead  at least thanks to regulation fair disclosure     reg  fd    analysts don  t get a secret call with the  real  numbers at another time than the public  we like that 
perhaps in a world of pro forma numbers  and ebitda    both of which phil weiss has skewered appropriately in past columns   the calls and press releases could never be expected to be that substantive  that makes individual investors increasingly correct to greet such information with cries of  bullfeathers   it only takes a few reviews of earnings press releases to make anyone a skeptic  the pr department carefully dresses them with spin  leaving the details for the fine print  headline   earnings up    revenues down     headline   revenues up    earnings down     the skullduggery of spin and pro forma mangles earnings to meaninglessness  
at least the conference calls themselves allow you a sense of managers as people and potentially some information about the business  but the financials are not helpful  why 
hiding the cash flow statement
because almost every company gives up only part of the financial picture at call and press release time  if the income statement is increasingly unhelpful  at least the balance sheet tells you whether the company has increased or decreased cash  right  well  not quite 
you really need the cash flow statement   the best measure of how the company  s business actually performs  even then  you may need to make further adjustments   yet the overwhelming majority of companies do not provide the cash flow statement at the call and press release time 
check the companies you own  if they don  t release cash flow statements with their earnings   or  at least  prior to sec filings  you should write and otherwise hound investor relations to push management to do so  encourage your fellow investors to do so too  and tell the company that the motley fool sent ya  they will maintain that the numbers aren  t ready at earnings time  tell them to wait until they are  the numbers are certainly ready in time for the sec deadline  and wouldn  t we be happy to wait a week or two for the complete picture  or  hey  why not do two releases   one when the earnings are ready and another for the cash flow 
if not releasing the cash flow statement were enron  s only sin  it wouldn  t be that big a deal  it has plenty of company  but this pre  halloween  scary tale gets worse  unfortunately for enron investors  the company does the hide  the  cash  flow  statement gig one better 
hiding the balance sheet
for at least the last three quarters that i checked  enron hides the balance sheet until sec filing time  that  s right  not just the cash flow statement  but the balance sheet too  all they release is the income statement   though  in truth  it does provide pages of income statement information for its many businesses  but why fail to release the balance sheet 
the only conclusion can be that management doesn  t want to show its cash balances until it can slip them into sec filings it thinks people won  t bother to read  when questioners on a conference call earlier this year urged former enron ceo jeffrey skilling to provide a balance sheet at earnings release  skilling reportedly  called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners  
off his meds that day  or a symptom of the company  s attitude towards shareholders  looks like the latter  skilling  s gone  but the practice hasn  t changed 
it  s about management
we don  t depend on management for the numbers during the quarterly public calls and releases  a publicly traded company  s financials will appear a few weeks later through its sec filings available through our quotes  data page   no investor should be buying   or holding   stock in companies if they don  t read their filings carefully  it  s hard enough to discern what  s going on in a business without doing so  and even in those filings   such as with options grants to management   the real meat is buried in footnotes  not reading   qs and   ks is like getting married without dating  or buying a car by paint color only 
what enron  s failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are sub  par  it says management is willing to hold these events  but it  ll be darned if it  ll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than management  s spin  in enron  s case  its former ceo heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change  does that make enron  s earnings releases circuses  draw your own conclusion 
is management listening  perhaps  it hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday  tmf community member emschulze took notes  
 on call  analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given company  s previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance    response was that balance sheet doesn  t normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in   q to be filed by nov      ceo indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future  implying that investors won  t have to wait all the way until   q filing deadlines to see balance sheet  
that  s a good sign  but until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time  enron should be in the doghouse 
good corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because today  s income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless  if it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together  what  s the problem  shareholders should demand no less  when a company trumpets an income statement  as enron has  no one should be surprised when smoke appears  and perhaps much more 
tom jacobs  tmf tom   would like to improve his own cash flow statement  at press time  he owned no shares of enron  to see his stock holdings  view his profile   and check out the motley fool  s disclosure policy

planned as an added feature on an existing web site   com  board analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year  she said 
only directors of u  s  companies will initially be evaluated  non  u  s  directors may be added later 
minow and partner robert monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights  they formerly managed the washington  based shareholder activist lens fund  which they sold last year to british fund management group hermes 
their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy  side  said industry spokespersons 
 there  s been growing interest within our membership in board membership  in general  and individual directors  in particular  i definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors   said ann yerger  spokeswoman for the council of institutional investors  which represents america  s large pension funds 
the corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the  s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible  many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors  but examples of lax board oversight still abound 
one example would be enron corp   whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the securities and exchange commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company  s chief financial officer  minow said 
 where was the enron board in all of this   she asked   boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these  that apparently didn  t happen here  
taking the corporate governance argument a step further  minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question  it should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company 
 this isn  t just a corporate governance thing  this is part of investment analysis   she said 
institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks  whether they will begin to examine directors  as well  remained an open question 
 nell and bob monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction   said peter gleason  vice president of research and development at the national association of corporate directors  which represents more than    corporate directors 
surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self  evaluation high on their list of concerns   more and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing   gleason said
