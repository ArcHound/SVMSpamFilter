below is a brief summary of the main issues regarding direct access  we will continue to the follow the progress and keep you updated 
summary 
direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key component of california  s  deregulation law  under this concept  all customers could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated utility  the debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attempt to solve california  s costly power crisis  it will determine whether businesses  with residential customers  pay for the bulk of the state  s future energy purchases  it also could determine whether southern california edison  the state  s cash  strapped no   utility  will avoid bankruptcy  and whether deregulation will survive in any form 
big businesses  free  market advocates and alternative energy providers have lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so  called  direct access   now  as the state prepares to sell     billion in bonds to begin paying off its debt  legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big businesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct  access escape route  regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the system  the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long  term electricity contracts through   that would mean residential ratepayers would be stuck paying the bulk of the   billion in future power costs  a point that has enraged consumer groups  currently  only about    customers buy their energy through direct access  per cec statistics   including about    large commercial  industrial customers  and about    residences  alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back to california  s primary utility suppliers  socal ed   pg  e  sdg  e  earlier this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with utility rates capped by the legislature 
california legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the latest edison bailout plan  sponsored by assembly speaker pro tem fred keeley  under the plan  the    largest businesses would agree to pay     billion of edison  s debts over  years  in exchange  businesses would be allowed to secure their own power contracts by   but not without first paying an  exit fee   the fees and which parties would be exempt remain undetermined  however  they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases  it is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding direct access  california  s business community will have extreme difficulty accepting the terms 
to ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fears of a collapsing state budget  lawmakers have gone so far as to introduce two bills   one sponsored by sen  bowen and defeated in july  and a second by assemblyman dave kelley   that would rescind language in previous legislation that authorized the public utilities commission to block direct access  the california puc has thus far stayed a decision on the matter  but is expected to rule by august  rd 
complicating the issue is wall street  the state  s bankers  led by j  p morgan  are nervous about selling as much as     billion in planned state bonds if businesses  currently the largest ratepayers in the state  after governments  find a way out of the system  the bonds are meant to repay the state for     billion in power  buying costs so far this year and to cover some future costs  business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills  if businesses were allowed to sign on with outside energy providers  that revenue stream would be in jeopardy
