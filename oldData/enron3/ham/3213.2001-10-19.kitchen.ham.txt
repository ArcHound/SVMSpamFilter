 c  reuters limited  
 new first paragraph  adds additional analyst comment 
by andrew kelly
houston  oct   reuters   enron corp  stock sustained further heavy losses on friday as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite was rocked by reports about the company  s relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by enron  s chief financial officer 
the energy giant  s stock closed down     or    percent at     per share  making a cumulative loss of  percent for a week in which enron reported a third  quarter loss of   million  its first quarterly loss in over four years 
analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the wall street journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of chief financial officer andrew fastow  who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from enron 
 i don  t think this thing passes the smell test   said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity   i think the cfo should be out of there right now  in the interest of the stockholders  that cfo should be gone   he said 
enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements  but fastow severed his ties with the ljm  partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities 
poor judgment 
analysts said that at the very least  the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at enron  which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high  profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer jeff skilling in august 
 for a company that had a lot of question marks around it already  these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors   said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade   it points to poor decision  making on behalf of the board and top management at enron   he said 
enron  north america  s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity  was one of wall street  s high flyers last year  when its stock posted a gain of  percent 
the stock  s ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company  s plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its enrononline internet energy trading platform 
this year enron  s shares have fallen  percent as sentiment toward broadband and the internet soured  skilling resigned after only six months as ceo  and the company  s dabhol power plant project in india became mired in a payments dispute 
moody  s investors service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron  s long  term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after enron took     billion in write  downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non  core businesses  including broadband and water services 
some of enron  s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings 
analysts said enron  s credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the ljm  partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead 
 what don  t we know that went on at that company  where  s the credibility   asked one frustrated analyst   we don  t know if it  s limited to this   he said

uk  jobs in base metals down but definitely not out 
by amanda cooper
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
london  oct   reuters   dismal industrial demand and the fickleness of hedge funds seduced by more volatile markets have slashed london metal exchange members  profits over the past year and set off a gathering wave of job cuts 
the decline and fall of base metal prices in the past year and a half has prompted a series of high  profile companies to withdraw from the market  casting a pall over next week  s yearly lme week industry gathering in london 
jobs have gone from front office to back in trading houses and banks  raising questions about the prospects for those now seeking work 
 good people can always be placed  as long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire   sarah gilley of london  based recruitment group exchange consulting said 
 where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets  people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies  
last week  scotiamocatta  a subsidiary of the bank of nova scotia and a key ring dealing member  unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the lme floor  prompting around  job losses among traders  phone jockeys and clerks 
then blue  blooded banker n  m  rothschild  sons closed its london and new york base metals units  it left its core precious metals business intact  but  base metals staff were laid off in the process 
in the same week  the lme  s largest floor trader  enron metals  said it planned to cut  to  percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut  to  jobs in the enron group 
security
with three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time  competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security 
 what we  re finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record  which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they  re keen to stay put   gilley said 
 so whereas someone who might be a big money  spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years  they are now staying for three to five years 
 they probably feel that they  re reasonably safe where they are  they  re well recognised and not going to stick their necks out   she said 
bonus fears
october has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by lme week functions and conferences
also  traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance  linked bonuses  which are usually announced at the end of the year 
 those who are in work at the moment are sticking  often at this time of year  people are hanging on for their bonuses  but i don  t think any of them are anticipating good bonuses  they  re probably just happy to have a job   sian griffiths of exchange consulting said 
lme volumes traded have been fallen over the past  months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi  tech and telecomms stocks 
metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients  and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market 
companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal 
 a lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re  aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it   gilley said 
 the other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing   she added 
as for morale in the industry  individuals  confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed 
 just because i  ve lost my job doesn  t mean i  m going to sell my porsche   one trader said
