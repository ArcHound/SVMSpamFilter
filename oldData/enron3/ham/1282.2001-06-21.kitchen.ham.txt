gkh  s drag  alone rights only extend to stock actually owned by jedi  or a subsequent purchaser in a  non exempt  transaction   to the extent we have disposed of a part of our interest in a public sale  an exempt transaction  the rights do not attach to the shares themselves 
if jedi sells to a third party in a non  public transaction  a  non exempt  transaction  this stock would be subject to the drag along  tag along conditions and the other provisions of the stockholders agreement  there are other restrictions that restrict partial sales in a non exempt transaction to less that   of the original share ownership 
enron has valued the hanover investment at the screen price for mark to market accounting based upon the free disposition in a public transaction  there is no question that any restriction on private sales theoretically impacts value negatively  on the other hand  the  tag along  rights theoretically have a positive impact on value 
in your example  if gkh sells to xyz subsequent to completion of enron  s sale to abc  in that case gkh could require abc to sell to xyz at    on the other hand if gkh cuts a deal to sell to xyz at    abc would have tag along rights of inclusion at

are we saying or not then that if 
scenario
ene sells to abc inc at  
gkh sells to xyz inc at  
xyz has the right buy abc  s shares at   
if this is right are we selling our shares with this drag along right  therefore heavily discounted

sales under a  act registration and rule  are  exempt transactions  per the jedi  gkh  hanover stockholders agreement  several months ago i confirmed with ray bowen that there are no other agreements that would restrict our dispositions via a public sale 
prior to actually starting a  process i would advise both gkh and hanover of our plans

dan  although it seems that the secondary offering lockup requirements rule out
the type of transaction discussed this morning  the issue of other restrictions
on jedi right to sell was introduced 
gkh has drag  along and jedi has tag  along rights 
there is an agreement among the company  gkh and jedi that restricts but does
not preclude disposition 
transfers to affiliates are ok
a registered offering or rule  disposition are ok
other sales involve a rofr 
written notice to company  days prior to proposed disposition to bona fide
purchaser
company has  days to respond to buy all or a portion of proposed
disposition on same terms and conditions
if company does not take all shares  any remaining offered to other
shareholder within  days
the other shareholder has  days to respond
these are the primary provisions  we would need a more detailed assessment of
the issue once a specific structure proposed  accepted 
let me know if i can help
