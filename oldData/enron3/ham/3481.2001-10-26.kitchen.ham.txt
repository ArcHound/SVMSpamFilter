enron corp  drew down about   billion  the bulk of its available bank credit lines  in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity 
enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about     billion of outstanding commercial paper   short  term corporate ious   according to a person familiar with the matter  with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion  some observers believe the move is a pre  emptive step by enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted  the person also said enron was talking to its banks about a new  multibillion  dollar credit line 
enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong  but   when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days  we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank   said an enron spokesman  in a statement  the company  s new chief financial officer  jeff mcmahon  said that by drawing down the bank lines   we are making it clear that enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments  
the move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy  trading concern in the past  days  enron is the nation  s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one  quarter of all electricity and natural  gas trades  yesterday  for example  enron was involved in about   billion of deals through its enrononline unit 
since early last week  enron  s share price has plummeted    last week  it reported a   million third  quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of     billion  it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer  andrew s  fastow  who was replaced wednesday 
the draw  down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency  fitch  put enron on review for a possible downgrade  while another  standard it takes time to sell assets  particularly in today  s slower economy 
the company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility  particularly in connection with its dealings with mr  fastow  the former chief financial officer  internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official  who has since left enron  while enron disclosed its fastow  related transactions in sec filings  a computerized search of the sec  s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee  related entity known as chewco 
chewco was established in   with approximately   million in capital commitments  to buy an interest in enron assets  according to one of the partnerships documents  the document didn  t further specify what assets were purchased  and it didn  t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron  chewco was being run by michael kopper  a managing director in enron  s global equity markets group  according to the document 
enron  which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee  related entities were legal and properly disclosed  didn  t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco 
mr  kopper  who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow  related partnerships  didn  t return phone calls  a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr  kopper was traveling  in response to questions about chewco  an enron spokesman would say only that  michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron   mr  fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests  he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july 
this statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related  party transactions  under sec rule s  k  a company has to report any transaction that exceeds     and involves  any director or executive officer   by contrast  mr  fastow  as cfo  would have fallen into that category  but mr  kopper  as managing director of a business unit  presumably wouldn  t have 
however  reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition  one that might include mr  kopper  according to fas statement   a related  party transaction involves a  material  piece of business between the company and a member of management  the statement defines management as directors  top officers  vice presidents in charge of major business units and  other persons who perform similar policy  making functions  persons without formal titles may also be members of management

officials at enron corp   whose unusual transactions with its chief financial officer are under regulatory scrutiny  have steadily sold sizable amounts of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this year 
corporate officials had sold    million shares valued at about   million through july  as the stock fell to less than   a share from   at the start of the year  since july  the stock has plummeted an additional   to      including a   plunge since the beginning of last week 
kenneth lay  chief executive of the houston energy  trading company  cashed in shares for     million so far this year  usually in transactions paired with options exercises  he sold    shares  leaving him with some    million shares as of july  the latest data available on his sales  according to thomson financial  lancer analytics 
the dollar amount for his  sales is approaching the total for all mr  lay  s sales of enron shares for   which reached     million  in   he sold shares for a total of   million 
in houston  an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures  saying the company doesn  t keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate officials  enron also wouldn  t comment on the number of options held by company insiders and called the sales  a personal decision   many sales by enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises 
strong selling by company officers and directors amid share  price declines should raise red flags for investors  says jonathan moreland  research director of insiderinsights  com  who uses insider  trading data to zero in on investment ideas 
among other insiders selling during the year  kenneth rice  former chairman and ceo of enron  s broadband unit  sold shares for     million  mr  rice has sold    shares of the    million shares he was listed as owning in enron  s march proxy filing  former enron chief executive jeffrey skilling   who resigned in august   sold    shares for     million during the year  in march  mr  skilling owned    million shares 
messrs  rice and skilling couldn  t be reached to comment 
overall  enron  s insiders were busier selling shares last year  when they sold    million shares for about   million  during   insiders sold    million shares for     million 
since december   only one enron executive has reported buying company shares  the buyer was andrew fastow  who was ousted during the week as enron  s chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial ties between the company and mr  fastow 
mr  fastow reported purchasing    enron shares in august at     each  or a total of      today  those shares are valued at      based on enron  s stock price of     in  p  m  new york stock exchange composite trading  after the purchase  mr  fastow owned    shares  thomson financial  lancer analytics says

enron  s financial troubles reverberate to bonds with poor liquidity and credit  rating concerns

new york   enron corp   s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy  trading powerhouse 
not for long  some bond traders say 
in trading yesterday  the houston company  s five  year bond  a   million issue due in july  carrying a coupon of      was quoted at  cents on the dollar  down from a bid of  late wednesday  and representing a   drop during the past two weeks 
that is far less than the   decline in enron  s stock price since the oct   disclosure of a     billion charge linked to soured investments  resulting in a   million third  quarter loss  but the fall in the bond  s price translates to a yield of    percentage points above bellwether u  s  government bonds  which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago  although enron still is an investment  grade credit  that kind of  spread  is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower 
enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound  disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than   billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances  yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline  investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds  yesterday  s  bid  for instance  was for a block of less than   million in bonds  a small percentage of a typical trade 
fueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit  rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles  including losses  a securities and exchange commission investigation  and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer 
 even at these levels  there  s very little buying interest   said harold rivkin  a principal at distressed  debt trader h  rivkin  co  in princeton  n  j 
in one sign of the ripple effects  the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging  the cost of a  default swap    in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default   rose to   of the size of the credit being insured  that was up from   a day earlier  and more than holders of lucent technologies inc  debt had to pay at the height of that technology company  s troubles earlier during the year 
even with its woes  enron remains an investment  grade company  most credit  rating agencies rate enron  s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment  grade level 
yet fitch said yesterday it put enron  s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade  following a similar move by moody  s investors service last week   standard  poor  s  a division of mcgraw hill cos   stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list  opting instead to revise its long  term ratings outlook to  negative   citing concerns about the company  s financial flexibility  
meanwhile  the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst   these are investment  grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels   said glenn reynolds  an analyst at credit sights inc   an independent fixed  income research firm in new york   they aren  t distressed yet  but they are headed in that direction  
if enron  s credit ratings fall  it would have implications far beyond the company  s ability to raise money  for an energy trader  a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments 
enron makes markets in a variety of commodities  though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas  the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber  metals  bandwidth capacity and steel  as a market maker matching buyers and sellers  enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation  s energy and gas markets 
enron  s credit  worthiness is hugely important  the better its credit rating  the cheaper it can hedge  or offset  its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers  without that credit rating  the cost of this high  margin  high  volume business starts to rise  a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to  or derived from  that of an underlying security or asset  such as a stock  bond or commodity 
 even if the company does retain its investment  grade rating  the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses   said mr  reynolds at credit sights inc   any prudent risk  manager  at enron  s counterparties    any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with enron    is going to be examining their exposure to enron  and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it   mr  reynolds said 
to be sure  enron  despite its recent woes  remains a strong company  credit analysts said   i don  t think anyone  s seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default   mr  reynolds said 
 so far  our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them   said ron barone  managing director of standard  poor  s utility energy project finance group   no one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified  and customers have publicly stated that it  s business as usual  
yet analysts say the arrival of distressed  debt traders on the scene could make life more difficult for enron and its management  traders expect enron  s new chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon and chairman kenneth lay to make the rounds of wall street next week  meeting with rating agencies  debt  trading desks  big bond holders and banks  including j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup inc

enron  rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about 
in recent years  wall street researchers have been overwhelmingly   critics would say blindly   enthusiastic about enron  even as they acknowledge not always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted for its soaring profits  now  enron is reporting steep losses from some of its most complicated transactions  which many on wall street still can  t figure out 
in a research note wednesday  goldman sachs analyst david fleischer conceded that scant corporate disclosure at the houston energy trader makes it difficult to value the company  the company  s  lack of disclosure and transparency   he says  is  a longstanding enron hallmark  
so is this a stock to avoid  in his view  hardly  goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its  u  s  select list   which consists of a few dozen top stock picks   but mr  fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm  s larger but prestigious  recommended list  of  or so favored stocks  where it has been since he joined goldman in  
 just because i can  t be specific in being able to create a simple model    doesn  t mean that you write off that industry and say  i can  t analyze it  or  i can  t figure it out    says mr  fleischer  who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares   if that were the case  there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn  t follow  
enron  s shares have dropped about   since last week 
 every sell  side analyst we spoke to early in  admitted that this was a black box   says jim chanos  principal of kynikos associates in new york  who has been selling enron stock short   trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall   throughout this year   it was really a trust  me story  when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust  
true  no stock picker is immune from bad calls  and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias  particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment  banking deals to be had 
but enron stands apart  precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company  s disclosure practices are lacking  which raises the question  how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company  s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable 
concerns about the way that enron runs its business aren  t new  many of the issues now plaguing enron  s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge  fund managers and independent accounting experts  yet time and again  wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company  s various partnership transactions 
besides those partnerships  enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings 
through it all  most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock  market darling  publicly dismissing questions about the firm  s accounting practices and level of disclosure  as of yesterday  of the  analysts who following the stock   had a  strong buy  or equivalent rating on the stock  according to thomson financial  first call  five others rated the stock a  buy   though not strongly 
only prudential securities  which downgraded the stock this week  has a  sell  rating on enron 
the bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high  profile examples of wall street taking a glass half  full stance  despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less  enthusiastic approach was warranted 
over the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index  s general collapse  analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence   particularly those who  like goldman  s mr  fleischer  own shares in the companies they cover  regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment  banking fees and other revenue 
enron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms  for instance  for one   million equity offering in  led by  credit suisse first boston  enron retained seven co  managers  including donaldson lufkin  jenrette  lehman brothers and merrill lynch 
 enron is a big company  and i don  t think you  re going to find a firm that hasn  t been involved   says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer  who still rates the stock a  strong buy  with a   price target   they pay a lot of investment  banking fees to wall street  
he adds   we do our analysis every day based on the information we have  are we here strictly to defend companies  that  s ludicrous  we  re here to provide information to investors     yes  i have the wrong recommendation on the stock  i don  t think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed  
mr  fleischer  whose firm also has served as an investment banker to enron  calls his holding  a meaningful investment  that is  not small   but he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised  mr  fleischer says his clients  are happy to know  he has a stake in enron  because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is 
in his research note wednesday  mr  fleischer called for complete disclosures of enron  s off  balance sheet partnerships  despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company  he wrote that he and many other investors historically  have given enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings  and position as an industry leader 
 there  s not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they  re going to make their money  but every quarter they do   he says   it  s hard to get inside to know all the transactions  but they do deliver  
csfb  s mr  launer also has been a longtime defender of the company  occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about enron in the financial press  on monday  he wrote that he expects questions about enron  s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue  but that he remains  confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for  enron  and an ultimate recovery in the share price  
 i know i  m wrong on the stock   mr  launer says  but he says that at these prices  he isn  t ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst  case scenario   under which he envisions enron having to issue as much as   billion worth of shares  diluting current holders   the stock doesn  t have much further to fall 
clearly  messrs  launer and flesicher aren  t alone   even in relative terms  analysts remain very bullish on this stock   says chuck hill  director of research at thomson financial  first call  the average rating for a stock on wall street is     or slightly shy of a  buy  rating  enron scores a      this may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out   mr  hill says 
in downgrading the stock this week  prudential analyst carol coale bumped it to  sell  from  buy   with a brief stop at  hold   while she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock  she openly concedes her recent downgrades come  too little  too late  
ms  coale says enron has been difficult to cover for years  she says the company  s disclosure practices fall far short of ideal  and senior executives are often evasive  even when presented with direct questions  for instance  she says three weeks ago she asked enron management if the company was under investigation by the securities and exchange commission  they said  no   she says 
in light of the company  s acknowledgment this week of an sec  inquiry   she asked enron about the previous denial   they told me it is an inquiry  not an investigation   she says  an enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the sec  s inquiry only last wednesday

action by enron halts stock  s fall
but credit ratings are being reviewed

the recent freefall of enron corp   s stock price stabilized thursday  a day after the world  s largest energy trader replaced its chief financial officer 
enron  under a cloud for a number of reasons  including an securities and exchange commission inquiry  also made two announcements thursday night aimed at reassuring the financial community 
in the announcements  enron said it had drawn more than   billion from its lines of credit and said that energy  trading business done through enrononline on thursday was above average levels 
houston  based enron banked the money and has no plans to spend it  a spokeswoman said 
 we are making it clear that enron has the full support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business   jeff mcmahon  who took over wednesday as chief financial officer  said in a written statement 
enron said it recorded more than    transactions through enrononline on thursday 
ken lay  chairman and chief executive officer  said   enron continues to be the market  maker of choice in wholesale and gas power markets  our customers continue to put their confidence in us  and our core businesses are strong and performing well  
earlier thursday  two credit rating agencies took actions regarding enron  s ratings  which j  p  morgan securities analyst anatol feygin described as  just more negative sentiment  
at one point in thursday morning trading on the new york stock exchange  shares in enron were up more than      but they closed down  cents at      as recently as oct    the stock closed at     
before the market closed  international credit  rating agency fitch put enron  which currently holds investment  grade credit ratings  on review for a possible downgrade  then after the market closed  standard  poor  s took two steps  it affirmed enron  s current ratings  but it also revised its long  term ratings outlook to negative 
moody  s investors service put all of enron  s long  term debt on review for potential downgrade last week 
enron  which noted that losing its investment  grade rating would take downgrades of three notches  said thursday it will do everything in its power to defend its current rating 
in the sec inquiry  federal securities regulators are reviewing transactions between enron and two private investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow  who was removed as enron  s chief financial officer wednesday  enron removed fastow as part of its bid to repair its damaged credibility 
wall street is also questioning certain of enron  s financing vehicles and is wondering whether the company will face hits to its balance sheet in the months ahead 
s  p said it was concerned that the sizable drop in enron  s market capitalization has negatively affected its financial flexibility and could hurt the company  s plans to rebuild its balance sheet 
but it also noted that the  fundamental strength  of enron  s energy marketing and trading business has remained steady 
unless enron  s rebuilds confidence among investors and business partners  fitch said  it could  impair enron  s financial flexibility and access to capital markets   which would hurt its ability to conduct business 
carol coale  an analyst at prudential securities in houston  said the actions by s source  world reporter  tm 
battered corporate america will receive an immediate dollars  bn  pounds  bn  tax rebate under a dollars  bn eocnomic stimulation package just approved by the republican  controlled house of representatives 
the controversial package  worth an estimated dollars  bn over three years  includes dollars  bn for companies next year alone  it was approved by the house late on wednesday by  votes to   but faces significant amendment in the senate  which is now under democrat control 
it has reopened a wide ideological rift between republicans  who favour corporate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession  and democrats  who  in a reprise of the roosevelt  new deal   prefer to see increased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects 
liberal lobby groups such as the citizens for tax justice and the center on budget and policy priorities claim the bill would hand back dollars    bn to the  biggest corporations  which  they say  are renowned for paying little or no tax 
the most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax  or amt  introduced in  to make sure firms could not avoid all tax payments  this  strongly supported by president bush  would be made retroactive so that all amt payments would be refunded 
the lobby groups and the non  partisan congressional research service calculate that this would give a dollars    bn boost to computer group ibm alone  while general motors would get back dollars  m and general electric dollars  m 
others to benefit include txu  the texas  based utility that is the us  s third largest energy supplier  which would would be given dollars  m  united airlines  the us  s second largest carrier  which is warning of bankruptcy  would receive dollars  m  and enron  the energy trading group forced to sack its finance director this week  would be given dollars  m 
democrat leaders in the senate are determined to erase this measure and dislike other proposals to boost firms  which include a   tax break for capital investment over three years worth dollars    bn this year alone  they say these amount to a  giant corporate giveaway  
mr bush and other republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would help companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay  offs and invest more  prompting an economic recovery that  at best  is likely to start in the new year 
 businesses are america  s employers  they  re the hardware store  the diner down the street  the gas station on the corner  they  re not the enemy of working families   the author of the plan  representative bill thomas of california  said 
democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package  s provisions for the growing numbers of jobless  arguing that much of the dollars  bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of states

harvey pitt  s s  e  c   from guard dog to friendly puppy

c   new york times company
can the new  friendlier securities and exchange commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy 
harvey l  pitt  the new s  e  c  chairman  set out this week to show that he is not like his predecessor  arthur levitt  in a speech to the american institute of certified public accountants   an organization whose senior leadership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against mr  levitt  s reform efforts   mr  pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at his predecessor 
from now on  he promised    the commission will make sound decisions  in a respectful  affirmative way  not in a demeaning  demanding or demonizing way    he spoke favorably of   pro forma   earnings reports  in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make even the worst profit figures look pretty  there was no mention of mr  levitt  s concerns about improper management of earnings 
on the heels of mr  pitt  s speech  the s  e  c  used a minor enforcement action to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward to report their own errors  the decision itself was reasonable  although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years  but the way the s  e  c  trumpeted it raised questions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather than a guard dog    is this amnesty for financial fraud    jane adams  the accounting analyst at credit suisse first boston and a former s  e  c  staff member  asked in a report to clients  she was not sure of the answer 
in an interview yesterday  mr  pitt dismissed such worries    no one is going to get away with anything    he said    what we are trying to do is create an environment where people feel comfortable   and can talk to the s  e  c    without feeling we are looking for a big splash   
a major embarrassment for accountants is having the s  e  c  force a client to restate its numbers  mr  pitt and his chief accountant  robert herdman  are sending signals that fewer such demands will be made    i am very much in favor of a vigorous enforcement program    mr  pitt said in the interview    but i am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting statements and restatements   
mr  pitt talks of companies   getting it right the first time    which would certainly be nice  but there is a risk that companies will become more aggressive in their accounting  figuring there will be no real penalty  like a restatement  if they are caught  that would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting 
in trying to sound comforting to the accountants  group   an organization that  as he noted  he had represented as a lawyer for two decades   mr  pitt has done little to reassure investors of his independence 
the proof  of course  will come in the performance  fortunately  the mess at enron gives the s  e  c  a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image  it will take time for the commission to determine if the company  s accounting was proper  but there need be no delay in forcing enron to clearly explain   rather than obfuscate as it has so far   the strange deals it made with partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer 
  this could    a former s  e  c  staff member said    focus the issue on whether companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosures    and it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite

enron draws down at least  bln usd from credit lines to boost mkt confidence
    
afx news
 c   by afp  extel news ltd
houston  afx   enron corp said it drew on committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of  bln usd as part of moves to restore market confidence in the company 
 we are making it clear that enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business   said newly appointed chief financial officer jeff mcmahon 
 this is an important step in our plan to restore investor confidence in enron  additionally  we will update investors over the next several days regarding our plans to maintain our long  term credit rating  
according to the wall street journal  enron drew down about  bln usd and will use part of the money to offer to redeem about    bln usd of outstanding commercial paper  with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion  the newspaper cited a person familiar with the matter 
it quoted observers as saying the move may be is a pre  emptive step by enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted 
the source also said enron is talking to its banks about a new  multi  billion  dollar credit line

copyright   dow jones let  s have a comfortable war
sure  we  re at war with a band of cave  dwelling outlaws hell bent on our annihilation  but would all freedom  loving americans please go out and buy some dvd players  maybe even a nice new car 
that was basically the message from the treasury department  on news that congress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism efforts and rebuilding following the attacks  officials at treasury applauded the sentiment  then politely suggested it would be even better for the economy if americans just went to stores and bought stuff   the economy is perhaps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the war on global terrorists   says betsy holahan  a department spokesperson   war bonds are an additional way for americans to show their patriotism  
for the record  we don  t think an issue of war bonds would be dumb  just superfluous  after all  nothing  s stopped americans from buying generic savings bonds   or better yet  treasuries   all of which finance spending by the federal government 
in the meantime  it  s a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds   which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice   at the same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop  war bonds notwithstanding  we  re a long way off from the era of ration books 
  enron again
last week  we noted the extent of alarm about enron  s  ene  nyse  news  commentary  revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped     billion  following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high  level transactions  following that disclosure  besieged cfo andrew fastow has finally left the company on what  s delicately termed a  leave of absence  
in july  fastow exited a limited partnership  from which he had reportedly reaped large profits  after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement  concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence 
but that won  t be an easy task  given the resentment about enron  s disinclination to explain its problems  one analyst called fastow  s departure  unsettling   noting that management had given the cfo its endorsement only the day before  sounding a note of exasperation  analysts at j  p  morgan chase  banc of america securities and prudential all downgraded the stock  and there could be more trouble to come  the securities and exchange commission has issued enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions 
  gold diggers
it  s understandable that investors felt panicky in september  unfortunately  some reacted by shoving their hard  earned money into gold funds  according to financial research corp   which tracks fund flows  the specialty precious  metals category was the best  selling equity category during september  with net inflows of   million 
granted  that  s not a huge sum in the mutual fund world  by comparison  during the same month  large growth funds saw net redemptions of     billion  but the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy  given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long 
sure  under the bizarre circumstances of late  they  ve enjoyed somewhat of a pop  according to morningstar  the average precious  metals fund is up     year to date  but over the past five years  the same category lost an embarrassing      by comparison  even large  cap growth funds   everybody  s favorite whipping boy   managed to post a positive return  in the same period  they were up     
moreover  circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades   a combination of attacks on the u  s  government and war   still don  t seem to have boosted gold prices significantly  despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks  they  re again approaching their pre  sept   levels  it  s too early to say  but it  s likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again 
  amazon amazes once again
amazon  amzn  nasdaq  news  commentary  still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter  well  at least it will post a pro forma operating profit 
ok  so maybe that wouldn  t include amazon  s service on     billion in long  term debt or extraordinary charges  in fact  a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy  meaningless aura of minor triumph  the company still hasn  t said when it will turn an economic profit 
for that matter  even the fourth  quarter prediction is iffy  after announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit  cfo warren jenson added the humble qualifier   there are no guarantees   amazon simultaneously lowered its forecast for fourth  quarter revenue  predicting that sales would be somewhere between flat and up by   compared with a year ago 
third  quarter trends weren  t encouraging  though sales overall were up slightly in the third quarter from a year ago  revenue from the company  s core books and music business actually fell    at least the company has made progress in cutting costs  a spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses have decreased by   over the past year 
incidentally  in the wake of amazon  s earnings report  two analysts made the belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock  which has fallen   from its high back in december   merrill lynch analyst henry blodget and sg cowen analyst scott reamer downgraded the stock to  neutral  from previous buy ratings   we thought there might be upside to our estimates   noted blodget   there wasn  t

enron taps   billion from bank lines in pre  emptive move to ensure liquidity
    
dow jones business news
 copyright  c    dow jones  company  inc  
embattled enron corp  drew down about   billion  the bulk of its available bank credit lines  in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity  friday  s wall street journal reported 
enron  ene  will use part of the money to offer to redeem around     billion in outstanding commercial paper   short  term corporate ious   according to a person familiar with the matter  with the remainder used to provide a cash cushion  this person also said that enron was talking to its banks about a new multibillion  dollar credit line  some observers thought the moves were a pre  emptive step by enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted 
enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong  but  when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days  we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank   said an enron spokesman  in a prepared statement  the company  s new chief financial officer  jeff mcmahon  said that by drawing down the bank lines   we are making it clear that enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments  
the move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy  trading firm in the past  days  enron is the nation  s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one  quarter of all electricity and natural  gas trades  thursday  for example  enron was involved in about   billion worth of deals through its enrononline unit 
since early last week  enron  s share price has plummeted    it has reported a   million third  quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of     billion  it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities run by its former chief financial officer  andrew s  fastow  who was replaced wednesday 
the draw  down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency  fitch  put enron on review for a possible downgrade while standard  poors changed enron  s credit outlook to negative from stable  moody  s investors service has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade  in order to fall below investment grade  enron  s credit rating would have to fall several notches 
if that were to happen  however  a host of bad consequences could follow  together with the sharp decline in its stock price  a noninvestment grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings  in that event  enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt  diluting the value of existing shares  as of  p  m  in new york stock exchange composite trading  enron shares were down six cents at

dallas  ap   kenneth lay  the chairman and chief executive of embattled enron corp   has resigned from the board of software company i  technologies 
 this is a very painful decision   lay said in a statement issued thursday by dallas  based i  technologies   but now that i am again taking on the ceo responsibilities at enron  i must reduce my outside activities  
lay resumed the chief executive  s job at enron in august after jeff skilling surprised investors by leaving the houston  based energy company

enron  s stock price has fallen nearly  percent since interest in the partnerships intensified  and the company acknowledged that the u  s  securities and exchange commission was investigating the arrangements
i  makes software to help companies manage their supply chains  and its clients include texas instruments  ford motor co  and dell computer corp

as enron  s woes unnerve investors about energy sector  analysts say its problems are isolated

new york  ap   as it grew over the past decade into the country  s largest natural gas and power marketing company  enron corp  became the de facto barometer of health within the energy trading sector 
wall street buoyed the stock prices of enron  s competitors based in part on the huge success of the houston  based company  s business model  now  executives and industry analysts hope to prevent enron  s internal tumult and free  falling stock price from undermining investors  confidence in the sector  they say the houston  based company  s problems should be viewed in isolation and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace 
 the marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was yesterday  a week ago or a month ago   said jim donnell  president of duke energy north america  a division of duke energy corp  that generates and trades power 
that opinion appeared to gain acceptance on thursday as shares of dynegy inc   el paso corp  and duke energy corp  rebounded from losses on wednesday  when enron  s latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of its rivals 
enron  s stock has fallen about  percent in the past week  and nearly  percent since january  and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytime soon 
the latest troubles began oct   when enron reported third quarter earnings  and a longtime concern among wall street analysts that executives were not entirely forthcoming only got worse 
first came reports that some of the company  s losses stemmed from partnerships managed by enron  s chief financial officer at the time  andrew fastow  that raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission 
then on wednesday  one day after enron chairman kenneth lay defended fastow  the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence 
 they created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didn  t come through with flying colors   said christopher ellinghaus  an analyst at williams capital group in new york 
enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old  which have little to do with the company  s wholesale energy business  which accounts for roughly  percent of profits 
analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the face of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices 
 even though  enron  shot themselves in the foot  the basic business is still sound and not likely to disappear   ellinghaus said 
ubs warburg analyst ronald barone echoed that sentiment 
 the collateral damage to the rest of the space  dynegy and el paso  is overdone   barone said 
on thursday  williams companies inc  of tulsa  okla   reported net income of   million and reliant resources inc  of houston reported   million in profits 
 it  s business as usual   said dynegy spokesman steve stengel 
not for enron  whose stock price began a steady descent  months ago when its nascent high  speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype  the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india and the surprise departure in august of then  chief executive jeff skilling was considered another bad sign 
on oct    enron reported a net loss of   million in the third quarter  taking a one  time charge of     billion attributed to investment losses  troubled assets and unit restructurings  excluding the charge  enron earned   million on     billion in revenues for the three months ending sept   
ellinghaus said the stocks of enron  s competitors were brought down wednesday because of  dire  speculation that enron  s troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of receivables to companies such as duke and dynegy 
 all i  m hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality   ellinghaus said 
enron did not return calls seeking comment thursday 
donnell of duke energy said the charlotte  n  c   based company is paying close attention to the enron situation and that there has been no indication of receivables not being paid 
 they continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to credit   he said   they  ve never missed a deadline

  no one is cutting trading lines that i can see  or demanding
different terms than before   
companies that trade as heavily as enron require cash every
day to settle positions  said kilduff  whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with enron 
some days  fimat will bet that natural  gas prices will fall 
while enron bets that they will rise  natural gas usually does one
or the other every day  and someone pays the difference 
  the liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor   
kilduff said    someone is paying someone else every day

enron asked citicorp inc  on tuesday to arrange a  
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets 
enron had about     billion of commercial paper  or short 
term unsecured debt  outstanding as of tuesday  traders said  the
company  which has a   billion program  has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the sec
investigation was announced  the traders said 
today  enron offered two  week commercial paper at a  percent
yield   to  basis points above comparably rated companies

  if enron  s credit went bad  or they folded up  that
agreement wouldn  t get picked up by someone else    tracy said 
enron also helps many u  s  utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall  any impairment on enron  s part to continue doing so
would trickle down to main street utilities  tracy said

enron employees watch options devalue as shares fall  correct 
 company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph  
houston  oct    bloomberg    enron corp  prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year  now  from the boardroom to the mailroom 
employees are sharing the pain 
enron  the largest energy trader  grants stock options to the
bulk of its    employees  under enron  s standard compensation
package  most employees get stock options equal to
 percent of their annual base salary  spokeswoman meredith
philipp said 
employees held    million exercisable options as of the end
of   all at average prices above the company  s current share
price  the stock has dropped  percent this year 
  virtually every option is under water right now    enron
spokeswoman karen denne said 
enron  s board sets the strike price for the options in
december or january  employees can  t cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price  at
the end of   enron shares were trading at      in december 
the board set a strike price of about   
shares of houston  based enron fell  cents to     today 
they have lost  percent of their value so far this week 
enron said monday that the securities and exchange commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by andrew fastow  who
was ousted as enron  s chief financial officer yesterday  one
partnership cost the company   million  and enron bought back 
million shares from a partnership at a cost of     billion 
enron named jeff mcmahon  head of its industrial markets
group  as cfo late yesterday 
unvested options
another    million options granted to enron employees
hadn  t vested as of the end of last year  about    million of
them  or  percent  were at prices ranging from     to   a
share  the rest vest at levels well above the current share price 
experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries  such as technology and telecommunications  say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options 
  it looks bad    said mark edwards  chairman of iquantic
buck  a mellon financial corp  unit that provides compensation
consulting    employees look at  the stock price  every day  and
it  s a continued disincentive to them   
while denne said enron doesn  t have any plans to reprice its
employees  options  the company did issue a one  time stock option
grant at     in august  when ken lay resumed his former role as
the company  s chief executive  lay  who had held the job for 
years  turned the position over to jeffrey skilling in february 
skilling quit in august  citing family reasons 
the august grant  which was equivalent to  percent of
employees  base salary  didn  t require a vesting period  but was
exercisable immediately  enron  s shares haven  t closed above
    since aug
