ees is now fully stepping into the texas wholesale market with this  talking to  municipals for aggregated power is ridiculous for ees to be doing  this has to be stopped along with ees providing the  whitepaper  products where they are providing wholesale products to san antonio and others  they are making enron look stupid in not communicating what they are doing with the wholesale desk when we are constantly finding out they are talking to customers in our sic codes that we have been working with toward a deal 
i think a meeting needs to be setup between lavorato and delainey or at your level to get this fixed  i have tried working with my peers at ees and they continue to lie to me and keep working customers in our sic code and even worse with iou  s and municipals

let me know if this is a possibility 
thanks
