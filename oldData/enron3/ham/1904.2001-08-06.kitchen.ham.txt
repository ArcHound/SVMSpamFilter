  ipps rise     last week our ipp composite rose      slightly
underperforming both the nasdaq        and the s   the article  s thesis does not
consider the potential for retirement of existing capacity  and   the
regional characteristics of the power generation market resist such broad
sweeping generalizations 
  credit spreads continue to improve importantly  while our ipp equity
composite has traded off more than   over the last few weeks  ipp credit
spreads continue to tighten  for example  while calpine shares have traded
off   since july   the spreads on cpn  s  year     notes due  have
actually tightened by more than  basis points  last week alone  cpn
spreads tightened by  basis points  while the stock traded off    to
cite another example  while mirant shares have traded off   over the same
period  the spreads on mir  s     notes due  have tightened by  basis
points 
  q  earnings review last week second quarter earnings results were
reported by black hills  cleco  dpl  entergy  mirant and orion power 
upside surprises were reported by dpl  etr  mir and orn  versus
expectations  mirant  s results were the strongest  coming in   above our
estimate  cleco was the only company that posted an earnings
disappointment  reporting q  results that were   below our estimate 
  power market update last week power prices were up considerably as
evidenced by the   increase in the mirant national power index  with the
exception of the western market  power prices got a boost from hot
temperatures that blanketed most of the country  the texas market
experienced unusual volatility owing to recent wholesale market design
changes and the initiation of a retail competition pilot program
