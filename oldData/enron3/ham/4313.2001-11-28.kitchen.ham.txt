houston   dow jones   dynegy inc   dyn  terminated its troubled merger agreement with enron corp   ene   backing away from the deal despite frantic last  minute attempts by both sides to save it 
dynegy wednesday cited enron  s breaches of representations  warranties  convenants and agreements  including the material adverse change provision 
the announcement came after standard  poor  s cut the beleaguered energy trader  s debt rating to b  minus  essentially rendering it to junk status 
the downgrade triggered financial covenants and raised the possibility that enron will be forced to file for protection under chapter  of the federal bankruptcy code  that could be a fatal blow for enron  which needs huge sums of cheap money to keep its trading operations alive 
standard  poor  s lowered its long  term rating on enron to b  minus from triple  b  minus  citing fears that dynegy would abandon its proposed purchase of enron 
the collapse of the dynegy purchase would create enormous pressure on enron  s credit profile because of enron  s limited access to capital at a time when extensive debt restructuring is necessary  s  p said 
 while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties  this doesn  t reflect a failure for the energy merchant business   dynegy said in announcing its decision 
however  dynegy said its energy delivery network and core businesses are solid  and the company and its industry peers are ready to absorb any added volatility in the energy market as the result of the potential loss of enron 
in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange  enron shares were down      or    to      dynegy  meanwhile  was down      or    at      also on the big board 
top executives of enron and dynegy had tried to salvage a deal to combine the two energy  trading companies amid growing signs that enron faced cash  flow problems as a result of a sharp downturn in its core trading business 
talks between enron and dynegy began in earnest over the weekend to cut the price of the all  stock transaction after enron  s share price had plummeted in the wake of disclosures that its future earnings wouldn  t be as high as originally anticipated  last month dynegy agreed to buy enron after the emergence of damaging revelations concerning a series of deals that allowed enron executives to profit personally at the expense of the company and its shareholders  those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation 
citing a person familiar with the situation  the wall street journal said wednesday that enron  s board late tuesday had informally agreed to a new share  exchange ratio of    shares of dynegy for each enron share tendered  down more than   from the original offer of    dynegy share for each enron share 
that latest proposed share  exchange ratio valued enron at     a share  or a total of     billion  that would compare with the original value of     a share  or     billion  in exchange for reducing the purchase price  some members of the enron team were insisting on more control over the merged company  dynegy also was considering an additional   million cash investment in enron  dynegy  together with chevrontexaco inc   cvx   has already injected     billion into enron in an effort to stabilize the company 
while struggling to keep the planned merger alive  enron also has been seeking to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings  enron has a total of about   billion of debt  of which about   billion comes due by the end of next year  last month enron said in a filing with the sec that a cut in its rating to below investment grade by any of the three major credit rating agencies  along with a decline in its stock price below certain levels  would trigger the need to repay  refinance or cash collateralize facilities totaling     billion 
dynegy said wednesday that it will go through with its acquisition of enron natural gas pipeline unit northern natural  omaha  neb   and said it has exercised its right to acquire the unit  s common shares 
chevrontexaco  which owns   of dynegy  contributed     billion to the proposed enron merger  and dynegy used that money to acquire the pipeline unit 
northern natural  which owns and operates    miles of interstate natural gas pipeline spanning from the permian basin of texas to the great lakes  has historically been a strong earnings contributor 
dynegy said the unit will be a positive addition to dynegy  s own energy delivery network

energy markets seen surviving enron  s woes  but changed

new york   dow jones   the energy markets built by enron corp   ene  will survive the company  s troubles  but they won  t emerge unscathed  traders and analysts said wednesday 
energy companies have had weeks to adjust to serious concerns about the houston  based giant  s creditworthiness  allowing a more or less orderly withdrawal of enron from the market before ratings agencies wednesday downgraded enron  s credit to junk  bond levels 
nevertheless  liquidity in the north american natural gas and electricity markets is expected to suffer and credit requirements are likely to be tightened in general  creating difficulties for some energy traders 
 this doesn  t spell the end of energy trading   said one trading manager for an independent power producer   the market is much bigger than enron  and that  s why enron fell  this does spell the spell the end of trading for companies that don  t have a strong physical asset base for at least a year or two as credit requirements are generally tightened  
moreover  small producers of natural gas or electricity that hedged their  output with enron earlier this year  when prices were much higher than they are now  will suffer if enron has trouble fulfilling those commitments 
enron warned in a filing with the securities and exchange commission last week that its ability to continue as a going concern would be threatened if its credit ratings were downgraded to noninvestment grade levels 
news of enron  s downgrade added  cents to  cents to natural gas futures at the new york mercantile exchange  as traders covering short positions sent the december contract to     per million british thermal units  traders said 
midwestern and southeastern power prices were also said to have risen due to trading inefficiencies after enron turned off its internet  based trading platform enrononline and higher gas prices 
prices have in all those markets have since fallen  but the moves point to the increased volatility and lessened efficiency some analysts and traders expect should enron exit the market entirely 
kyle cooper  energy analyst at salomon smith barney  said traders will have to present wider bid  offer spreads in order to get deals done in markets in which enron provided critical liquidity 
 one less player  one less market  because of the illiquidity   cooper said 
at one time  enron accounted for about a quarter of all trade in the north american gas and power markets

uk  enron  a pioneer of europe  s new power markets

london  nov   reuters   u  s  group enron  on the brink of collapse on wednesday  has been a pioneer of energy dealing in europe and its demise would rob utilities across the continent of a key trading partner 
with a european staff of     offices in most major cities and a lavish headquarters overlooking london  s buckingham palace  enron created the trading culture now embraced by previously sceptical european utilities as markets open up to competition 
until recently  enron had accounted for about  percent of german wholesale power trading  it was also a major player in uk gas and electricity and nordic power  and was driving forward a fledgling french power market 
 on average we are now doing around  deals a day with about  counterparties   enron  s director of continental power trading gregor baeumerich told reuters in an interview last month  days before the group was plunged into its current crisis 
britain  s forward gas market rallied on wednesday as it emerged that a rescue deal from smaller rival dynegy had unravelled and enron looked to be skating dangerously close to bankruptcy 
enron  s list of trading partners included major utilities such as german giants e  on and rwe and the uk  s innogy and british energy
u  s  companies with trading desk in europe  such as txu  aep  dynegy and duke energy  also traded with enron 
the company  s enrononline internet trading platform  suspended earlier on wednesday  set the standard for online trading  offering a blueprint followed by utilities and brokers 
enron did about  percent of its trade through the platform 
the group  s presence in europe is not confined to trading  the company has around    megawatts of power generation  spanning italy  poland  greece and the uk where it owns one of the biggest plants at teesside 
the company built a reputation for hard  nosed trading expertise in europe  s previously pedestrian utilities industry and its approach seemed almost evangelical 
in the summer  flushed with confidence  the company placed a bmw sports car in the lobby of its london office  a prize for employees successful in recruiting fresh talent for the enron cause

usa  wrapup   enron near collapse after dynegy pulls out

reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
houston  nov   reuters   enron corp  swooned at the edge of one of the biggest corporate collapses in u  s  history on wednesday as its rescue by rival dynegy inc  blew apart 
dynegy accused enron of breaching the representations it made when a takeover agreement was negotiated on nov    invoking an escape clause that let it pull out of the all  stock deal valued at     billion at the time 
shares of enron  recently ranked no   on the fortune  list of the biggest u  s  companies  had lost most of their value in the past three weeks  and all three major credit rating agencies had slashed their ratings on enron  s bonds to junk status by the time dynegy made its announcement 
enron  s latest disaster marked another low in a stunning free  fall that began innocently enough with the announcement of a   million quarterly loss six weeks ago  surprise disclosures  including the admission it overstated earnings by almost   million since  and kept huge debts off its balance sheet  led investors to rapidly lose faith in a company valued at almost   billion a little more than a year ago 
on wednesday  its market value was less than   million 
in response to dynegy  s announcements and credit rating downgrades  enron said it will temporary suspend all payments other than those necessary to maintain its core operations 
kenneth l  lay  enron  s chairman and chief executive  said the company was evaluating and exploring other options to protect its core energy businesses 
the loss of enron  s investment  grade credit rating forces some     billion in debts to come due immediately  a major problem for a company that has spent most of the     billion it sought in recent weeks to stay afloat  enron said in a recent regulatory filing that it was unlikely to  continue as a going concern  were its credit rating to be slashed to junk status 
it became increasingly clear  as dynegy sought to renegotiate the deal  that enron  s tricky and often indecipherable accounting was becoming a sticking point  sources close to the negotiations said 
 while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties  this does not reflect a failure of the merchant energy business   dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in a statement 
dynegy said it would exercise its option to buy enron  s northern natural gas pipeline with the     billion it and partner chevrontexaco put into the deal 
dynegy said it stopped trading with enron as of wednesday morning  pegging its exposure at   million 
a bad sign came earlier on wednesday  as energy traders said operations had stopped at enron  s once highly lucrative online trading system  enrononline  the unit accounted for up to  percent of enron  s earnings  and was considered the jewel of the trading franchise that dynegy coveted most in its planned     billion all  stock takeover 
risk management failures
enron  which touted itself as an agile risk manager  found its credit and debt had spiraled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused investors to lose faith in recent weeks 
the partnerships  which included top enron executives and are the subject of a u  s  securities and exchange investigation  provided financing in exchange for guarantees that enron  s stock stay above certain levels and its credit remain investment  grade  but they came back onto the balance sheet with a vengeance  as enron found it would have to meet massive debt obligations as its shares and credit fell 
enron shares plunged      or  percent  to  cents on wednesday  as the new york stock exchange twice halted trading of enron shares before announcements affecting the company  it  s stock has fallen more than  percent this year 
the stock peaked at     in august   riding high on the cresting wave of the technology boom after enron took its trading outfit online and promised to bring its business model into the broadband communications arena 
 they  enron  entrapped the sophisticates   said robert stovall  senior strategist at prudential securities  referring to what was once an almost fawning admiration for enron by institutional investors   i think this is going to become a classic case  
stovall  with nearly  years of wall street experience  said he could not recall any previous corporate unraveling that matches that of enron 
 you would have to go to pre  sec days for that   he said  referring to the creation of the sec in the aftermath of the stock market crash of  
the final cuts
standard  poor  s  moody  s investors service and fitch all cut their ratings on the fallen energy trading giant  s debt to junk status  s  p said it had lost confidence in enron  s ability to complete the merger with dynegy  and said bankruptcy was a  distinct possibility  if the merger fails 
andre meade  a commerzbank analyst who has been consistently bearish on enron and the deal  said its core business deteriorated at an increasing pace in recent weeks  and the ratings agencies could not find the liquidity they wanted inside enron 
 the numbers were not enough to soothe them   said meade  who downgraded enron to  sell  from  hold  on wednesday   this company should have been downgraded to junk weeks ago  the ratings agencies had given them several weeks  and they just couldn  t hold out anymore  
dynegy on nov   said it would take over enron in a deal valued at about     per enron share  chevrontexaco corp   a major dynegy shareholder  pledged to immediately pump     billion into enron to bolster its withering finances 
deal advisers j  p  morgan chase and citigroup have already contributed   billion to the deal  and were expected to have to put up after enron was rebuffed by private equity firms it had approached seeking more cash 
representatives of dynegy and enron had haggled over new terms for the takeover late into tuesday  including a buyout offer half the original price  sources close to the talks said 
enron  s crash began when it said it would take     billion in writedowns and charges against its third  quarter earnings for failed investments  it later admitted that it had to reduce stockholder equity by     billion to extract itself from partnerships in which now  ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow the managing partner 
those deals  in which fastow earned about   million in management fees  are the subject of an sec investigation and the  worse yet for enron  it was required to restate its earnings going back four years  shaving off   million in the process

 c  reuters limited  
new york  nov   reuters   enron corp  s internet  based energy and metals trading system was shut down on wednesday  shortly after a leading credit  rating agency downgraded the company  s debt to  junk  status  energy traders said 
it was not clear whether the enrononline trading system was halted deliberately or by a technical problem  enron officials were not immediately available for comment 
 we were watching the board and suddenly it went blank   said one northeast natural gas trader  activity on enrononline was halted just after  a  m    gmt   the trader said 
energy traders said the standard  poor  s announcement that it was downgrading enron debt triggered a brief spike in new york mercantile exchange natural gas futures  to     per million btu  but prices later slipped to the low      s  still up more than  cents from tuesday 
 we spiked on the enron news  people ran in to cover any exposure because of the uncertainty  i think they  re expecting the company to file for chapter   bankruptcy    said one midwest gas and power trader 
 the enron  stock  halt sent a shock through the  power  market and all trading stopped  the enron guys pulled all their numbers  on enrononline    another trader at a houston  based energy firm said 
u  s  natural gas and electricity firms have been steadily scaling back deals with enron for several weeks as fears mounted about the former energy giant  s credit standing 
 people have been balancing their risk exposure over the last few weeks   another midwest trader said 
enron was by far the largest u  s  natural gas and electricity trader  with industry analysts estimating it was once involved in some  percent of daily trade in those markets 
but since last month  when the company became the target of a securities and exchange commission investigation of financial dealings with partnerships  the houston  based company  s market share has steadily eroded 
enrononline until recently accounted for about  percent of the daily trade volume handled by enron

washington  nov   reuters   the chairman of the u  s  house energy and commerce committee said on wednesday he could not see how the government could come to the rescue of enron corp   near collapse after rival energy trader dynergy inc  pulled out of a deal to buy it 
 i can  t right now envision anything the government can do  other than encourage the parties who are discussing a merger to continue their efforts   said billy tauzin  republican of louisiana 
but he said the government must watch carefully whether the troubles of the houston  based enron  once ranked as the nation  s largest trader of electricity and natural gas  had implications for u  s  energy supplies and pricing 
tauzin noted that enron had been a  very big contributor  to energy supplies in california  which was rocked last winter by a tenfold jump in wholesale electricity prices  a string of black  outs and the bankruptcy of the state  s largest utility 
 we  ve got to watch that very carefully  obviously  we don  t want to be in another session next year trying to deal with energy problems in california as a result of some of the events that are occurring right now with enron   tauzin said 
the underlying cause of california  s problems last winter was widely seen as the state  s badly written electricity deregulation law  which did not allow power companies to pass through higher wholesale electricity costs to consumers 
tauzin said enron  s decline was unfortunate   it  s a sad story  it  s been a hugely successful enterprise  
 i would hope they could work it out  we can  t simply step into every bad market decision and every bad financing decision that occurs in american corporations in this country and work it out for them  we have to count on them to figure it out themselves  
 our job is going to be to make sure in policy we haven  t left a breach open where consumers are going to end up short or overpriced in the process   he added 
enron  s financial problems have steadily unravelled since last month  when it became the target of a securities and exchange commission investigation of some enron partnerships 
on wednesday  dynergy said it called off its plan to buy enron in a   billion stock deal  citing breaches in the merger agreement  the company  s credit ratings were downgraded to junk status

san francisco  nov   reuters   nymex hub gas  up midday wednesday on enron corp   s financial troubles  tumbled late after bearish aga data was released this afternoon  traders said 
 healthy supplies continue to be confirmed week after week with these aga reports  until we see a guy in chicago with ice coming off his nose we will go lower because supplies are abundant and there  s no demand   one northeast trader said 
the trader said front  month nymex prices could fall below   per mmbtu in the days ahead if widespread and sustainable cold weather failed to materialize 
at    p  m  est  december was down    cents at     per million british thermal units  mmbtu  after aga data was released 
earlier in the session  december  which expires today  rocketed to     after standard  poor  s cut energy trading giant enron  s debt to junk status  a move that threw into question the company  s ability to meet its financial obligations 
enron is by far the largest u  s  gas and electricity trader  with industry analysts estimating it was once involved in some  percent of daily trade in those markets 
aga storage data released this afternoon showed u  s  gas stocks for the week ended nov   rose by  bcf  well above reuters survey estimates for an unchanged  to  bcf withdrawal number  the year  ago slide of  bcf and the five  year average pull of  bcf 
total inventories of    tcf jumped to  bcf  or  percent  above last year and  bcf above the five year average 
last week  storage  which stands at  percent full  broke the all  time record high of    tcf hit on nov     
most analysts expect the gas glut to grow further in coming weeks  noting last year more than  tcf was drawn from inventory during a record cold november  december period 
eastern stocks were unchanged at  percent of capacity  about  percent above last year  consuming region west storage  which rose  bcf for the week  was  percent above year  ago levels  inventories in the producing region gained  bcf and stood  percent above  levels

copyright   dow jones less than a year ago  they were trading at      dynegy shares were off      or  percent  to     
in a statement  dynegy said enron had breached its acquisition agreement  triggering a  material adverse  clause and causing it to call of the deal 
 while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties  this does not reflect a failure of the energy merchant business   said dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson 
the dynegy move came after standard  poor  s and moody  s investors service both cited a loss of confidence that the deal will be consummated  and said that dynegy  s willingness to go through with the buyout has been compromised by continued erosion in investor confidence and enron  s core energy trading business 
the downgrades make     billion of enron debt due immediately  and up to   billion in other debt originally due next year could come due earlier 
in its statement  dynegy also said it would exercise its right to purchase enron  s northern natural gas pipeline  an option it received after it and chevrontexaco  which holds a  percent stake in dynegy  pumped     million into the ailing enron 
despite dynegy  s claim to the pipeline  analysts are anticipating a battle over enron  s assets in bankruptcy court 
 it  s going to be a fight  between dynegy and enron  s creditors  howald said 
spokesmen for both enron and dynegy didn  t immediately return repeated calls seeking comment wednesday  though dynegy scheduled a conference call for later in the afternoon 
enron and dynegy  both based in houston  had spent the last several days trying to hammer out a revision to their nov   merger agreement  which valued enron stock at more than   per share 
 this comes in response to the fact that they weren  t able to craft a deal last night  they were working on getting more cash  from banks shepherding the merger  last night  but they didn  t get it   said a  g  edwards  sons analyst mike heim said   i think bankruptcy  s not too far away  
raymond james analyst jon kyle cartwright predicted dynegy will survive with a few battle scars 
 i believe we all misunderstood how dramatic a credibility crisis can be in a recession in a bear market   he said   the speed at which enron collapsed caught us all off guard  
enron last month revealed that partnerships run by its executives had allowed the company to keep about half a billion in debt off its books and allowed the executives to profit from the arrangements  enron  s dealings with those partnerships are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation 
the company ousted its top financial officer in october  and several weeks ago restated its earnings back to   eliminating more than   million in reported income

standard  poor  s corp  cut enron  s credit rating to junk as

concern was heightened after enron disclosed a previously

it terminated its agreement because enron breached covenants

trading doubts
enron faced a cash crunch in part because some trading
partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay
bills  as a result  they either demanded more collateral to trade
or restricting trading with the houston  based company 
enrononline  enron corp   s online trading system  stopped
allowing trades and quit posting bids and offers for natural gas
late this morning  say traders who use the web site  enron said
yesterday that enrononline handles about  percent of its trading
business  or about     billion a day in trading on average over
the last  days 
  we can log in  but there is nothing there  nothing to buy
and nothing to sell    said juha laiho  an energy trader at
finland  based fortum oyj in houston    it went down some time
this morning   
s in both 
and   it had been less than a majority 
participants in the plan  which had     billion in assets
available for benefits  could only do so much to diversify their
investments  enron  like many other companies  used stock rather
than cash to match employee contributions and restricted sales of
the shares 
and they could only guess at the year  end makeup of the plan  s
assets until the end of june  reflecting sec disclosure standards
for savings plans  by that time  the stock  s drop   which reached
 percent today   was already well under way 
trio of lawsuits
enron later reported     billion in third  quarter charges 
ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow  who ran partnerships
that accounted for some of the charges  restated its results since
  became the target of an sec accounting investigation  and
accepted a takeover bid from dynegy inc   its biggest rival 
the company  s shares  which ended last year at      fell as
low as     today before a midday trading halt as enron  s debt was
downgraded to junk  bond status and dynegy abandoned its offer 
in response to the plunge  employees in the   k  plan  
which allows workers to defer part of their pay and build tax  free
savings  and takes its name from a section of the internal revenue
service code   have filed three lawsuits against enron 
the suits allege  among other things  that the houston  based
company prevented employees from shifting investments within the
plan between oct    the day after its disclosure of the charges 
and nov   as the company made administrative changes 
all three seek class  action status on behalf of the plan  s
participants  the most recent filing came from the gottesdiener law
firm  based in washington  on monday  it covers the longest time
period  november  to now 
falling percentages
enron shares accounted for  percent of the savings plan  s
assets at the end of   the year before the period associated
with the gottesdiner suit began  the figure reflected a one  time
company contribution of preferred stock  and rose from  percent
in  
each preferred share has a face value of   and is
convertible into    common shares  this translates into a
conversion price of     a share  which was a bargain before
today  s trading 
the plan also owned a stake in enron  s former oil and gas
unit  which became eog resources inc  after gaining independence in
  add in those shares  and company stock represented about two 
thirds of the  assets 
enron  s common and preferred shares fell to  percent of
  k  assets available for benefits in    percent in 
and  percent in  as the u  s  stock market rallied  lifting
the value of participants  investments in equity mutual funds 
the shares represented  percent of the plan  s assets in
  the proportion hit bottom at  percent in   when the
assets more than doubled   exceeding the  percent increase in
enron  s share price that year   to     billion 
how much choice 
then came last year  when the common shares recorded their
best performance in more than two decades even as u  s  stocks
stumbled  enron rallied  percent amid soaring electricity and
natural gas prices  while the standard  poor  s  index  a market
benchmark that includes the company  fell  percent 
company shares in the plan rose in value by     million 
according to an sec filing  the total includes shares bought and
sold throughout the year  by contrast  mutual  fund holdings fell by
  million and   other investments   rose by just      the
filing said 
at year  end  the   k  plan owned    million enron common
shares and    preferred shares  valued at     billion  this
total encompasses not only enron  s matching contributions to the
plan  but also employees  investments with their own money 
the company generally provides a  percent match  in stock 
for the first  percent of pay that goes into the plan  employees
can  t sell the shares and move the proceeds into other investment
choices until they reach the age of  
company contributions accounted for about  percent of the
plan  s stock holdings  said karen denne  an enron spokeswoman  the
figure suggests employees invested more heavily in their company
than usual for   k  participants 
waiting for data
for the average u  s  plan account  company stock amounted to
 percent of assets at the end of last year  according to a study
done by the employee benefit research institute and the investment
company institute and published last week 
in any case  enron  s approach to matching ensures that as much
as one  third of the contribution to an employee  s account takes the
form of shares that they can  t sell right away 
anyone who wanted to gauge how this approach  and enron  s
stock performance  affected the plan  s financial position last year
had to wait until june   that  s when the filing cited earlier
arrived at the sec 
employee savings and stock  purchase plans  such as   k 
plans  don  t have to submit annual reports until  days after
their fiscal year ends  they can even get a   day extension of the
deadline if they need one 
by the time enron  s plan made its annual report  it was
already a bit too late to act on the information  the company  s
shares dropped  percent between the end of  and the date of
the submission  as the filing demonstrated  employees looking to
save for retirement had been set up for a fall

deterioration
  we saw the deterioration in the trading operations  and
that threw the merger in doubt    said s  p analyst todd shipman
and the author of the report 
enron has     billion of debt outstanding  according to
bloomberg data  its shares  which have fallen    percent so far
this year  lost     cents today and are now trading at  cents 
enron  s stock had fallen by more than  percent since nov 
 amid growing skepticism that the dynegy would complete the
acquisition 
  we became a lot more concerned when the stock didn  t
stabilize    said john diaz  moody  s managing director for energy
and one of the authors of the report    the drop in the stock
price put pressure on dynegy to renegotiate the deal   
cash burn
shipman said in his report that   the willingness of dynegy
to complete its planned acquisition of enron has been compromised
by the continued drop in confidence in the capital markets that
the transaction would hold   
credit analysts also focused on enron  s   cash burn   rate 
diaz said  enron said in its most recent filing last week that it
had   billion in cash  which was a lot less than the market had
expected  diaz said 
  it came as a surprise to us and to others    he said    we
expected at least     billion so they would have staying power

commission  s role
marc hellman  the administrator responsible for mergers and
acquisitions at the oregon public utility commission  said he is
unsure what would happen if enron were to file for bankruptcy
protection 
  i can  t recall it ever happening  and i  ve been here for
 years    hellman said    if it went all the way to the end 
where they  re liquidating assets  you can  t sell utility property
without commission approval  there are probably some issues where
our attorney general  s office may look into it   
hellman said he has heard nothing to indicate northwest
natural  s purchase of pge wouldn  t go forward 
  enron was getting cash from northwest natural for the
purchase  as well as shares    hellman said    that aspect of the
transaction becomes a little curious if enron is going through
bankruptcy

ratings once northwest natural completed its acquisition of the

  however  today  s rating action is being taken in advance of
the expected closing of that transaction to reflect moody  s
concerns surrounding portland general  s ability to remain fully
insulated from the many financial challenges currently being faced

floors  each of the top  stories is    square feet 
when the project was announced two years ago  enron needed
more space to house a growing workforce  its stock price hit a
