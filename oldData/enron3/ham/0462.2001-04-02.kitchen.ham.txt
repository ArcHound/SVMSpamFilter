Subject friday p  l
i have just been informed that our p  l was overstated by approx   million on friday  since it is quarter end  we are re  calcing to avoid numerous audit issues that would result  the mistake was due to vol curves rolling forward one month  may became june  june became july  july became aug  etc   
starting tommorow  harry will be responsible for marking all vol curves for east power  the vol curve changes that harry will be making over the next two days will result in a marginal gain in desk p  l     million   most of the regional books gain value due to short vol position  however  the new albany spread option loses a corresponding amount 
the recent risk group difficulties are compounded by the portland risk group being down to  people  total experience of  months  and many of our resources are getting sucked into west issues  continued system difficulties combined with understaffing has resulted in more frequent mistakes 
the   million of p  l for friday business can be reconciled as follows 
  million from thursday mistake  p  l understated on thursday because wednesday curves were used after port calc failed 
  million in  true  friday p  l  summer   cal   cal  all down approx     mwh 
  million overstated due to vol curve being off by one month from incorrect roll in vol curves 
the final p  l issued by    pm today  for cob friday  will be approx    million
