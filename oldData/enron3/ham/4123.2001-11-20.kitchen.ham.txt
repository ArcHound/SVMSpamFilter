Subject enron direct canada corp   lc  s expiring     
sent on behalf of derek flaman 
the following is a response to bill  s question   when does the tariff require the lc to be renewed  do we have some time to wait until mid  december  
also attached to this email is lori poffenroth  s november  memo which sets forth lori  s calculations based on wsp  ppa  s formulas set forth in their tariffs for initial amounts  revised amounts  recommended october  amounts  and estimated december  amounts 
all of the wsp  s and the ppa  s prudential requirements allow the wsp  s and the ppa to reevaluate edcc  s credit limit and  or request additional security from time to time  while the following sets out in more detail the manner in which each wsp and the ppa can do this  all of the prudential requirements are the same in the following two respects     if at any time edcc  s financial obligations to the wsp  ppa  the  financial obligations   exceed the existing credit limit  or a certain percentage thereof   the wsp  ppa has the right to request additional security  the  additional security    and    if edcc fails to post the additional security within the requisite time period  the wsp  ppa reserves the right to suspend service to edcc 
note that  as of today  no wsp  ppa has requested additional security 
however  as soon as possible  the following needs to occur in those instances where the october  amount exceeds the existing amount     we should post the additional security now  or    we put ourselves in a position to be able to post the additional security within the requisite time period  consequently  we do have some time to wait until mid  december provided that    has occurred 
as at december   we must post the december  amount
