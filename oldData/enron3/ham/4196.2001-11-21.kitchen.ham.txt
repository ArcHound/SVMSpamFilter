enron says repayment of  mln usd debt extended until mid  dec
    
afx news
 c   by afp  extel news ltd
houston  afx   enron corp said its creditor banks have granted an extension on a  mln usd note payable by nov  until mid  december  giving it enough time to restructure the debt 
in a statement  the troubled energy company said the extension has been agreed following talks with its main creditor banks on restructuring its debt to avoid a liquidity crisis 
 we have been in continuous contact with our banks and believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to enhance our cash position  strengthen our balance sheet and address upcoming maturities   said chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon 
enron first informed investors of the possibility it would be forced to repay the  mln usd note in a filing to the securities and exchange commission on monday 
the obligation arose after standard  poor  s cut the company  s long  term debt rating to bbb  last week  forcing it to either post collateral on the note or repay it on maturity 
enron said it has also secured the remaining  mln usd of a previously announced  bln usd credit line from jp morgan and salomon smith barney  the facility is secured by the assets of enron  s northern natural gas co unit 
the other  mln usd are secured by the assets of its transwestern pipeline co 
enron also said it is still committed to its merger with dynegy inc  announced on nov  
 we continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders  employees  and lenders   said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay   it offers the opportunity to create a formidable player in the merchant energy business with substantial growth prospects and a strong financial position  
jp morgan chase vice chairman james lee said the bank will work with enron and its other creditor banks  to develop a plan to strengthen enron  s financial position up to and through its merger with dynegy   which is expected to close in the third quarter of

houston  ap   shares of embattled enron corp  plunged another  percent wednesday morning as analysts and investors continued to doubt the once  mighty energy trader  s ability to recover lost business and investor confidence 
in a report released wednesday  goldman sachs  co  analyst david fleischer became the latest to question enron  s future  saying that an sec filing by the houston  based company earlier this week  raised new issues about liquidity and the ability of the company to even finance itself over the next several months  
analysts are also questioning whether dynegy inc   s planned dlrs    billion acquisition of enron will survive given the latest revelations 
documents filed with the securities and exchange commission by enron late monday restated the company  s third  quarter earnings and stated that it may have to repay a dlrs  million debt by next week because of decreased credit ratings 
the filing also noted that enron  s financial woes have led to a  reduced level of transaction activity  with the company by trading partners 
enron shares fell  percent tuesday  then dropped another dlrs     or  percent  to dlrs    wednesday in extremely heavy trading on the new york stock exchange 
fleischer said enron  s nov   cash balance of dlrs    billion is inadequate to meet remaining debt obligations 
fleischer acknowledged  however  enron  s efforts to renegotiate next week  s due date for the dlrs  million debt  which was triggered nov   when the company  s credit rating was downgraded to bbb   saying that there are indications that enron  s banks may be willing to roll current maturities over and even make new equity investments 
michelle foss  director of the energy institute at the university of houston  said this latest round of troubles had to raise concerns about whether the dynegy  enron deal will be pulled off 
 it doesn  t look like it  s going to be able to happen   foss said   it did look like a decent idea when they proposed the merger  but today i  m sure they  ll look at it and see if they can salvage their attempt to buy enron  
shares of dynegy were off dlrs    to dlrs    in trading on the nyse 
  
tobacco suits by venezuela  brazil  s espirito santo dropped

 this is another important reminder to american plaintiffs  lawyers that a state court won  t ignore the overwhelming number of decisions by federal courts rejecting these lawsuits   william s  ohlemeyer  philip morris cos  vice president  said tuesday after the decisions 
attorneys for several foreign governments have filed an assortment of lawsuits in u  s  federal and state courts in an attempt to find some legal mechanism that withstands judicial scrutiny 
russia and other brazilian states are among the foreign governments that have sued in miami  where a verdict of dlrs  billion was awarded to florida smokers against the five biggest u  s  cigarette makers 
ecuador  s suit in miami was withdrawn earlier when another state judge announced his intention to dismiss it

charles kadlec  j  w seligman  peter  it  s chuck kadlec  good morning  is this is a heroic recommendation here  is this  should we consider this more of a speculative investment or is this something that a conservative investor ought to be interested in 
ausnit  i think investors should be interested in this if  over the next several quarters  in the near  term  the conditions are still quite difficult but over the long  term it  s not that speculative  xerox has a large install base  a tremendous sales and service force and can probably return to industry standard margins 
kadlec  as you say  this probably depends on management  s ability to execute here  why do you believe this management is going to be able to execute their strategy 
ausnit  well their track records during the turnaround has been fairly strong and the strategy has made a lot of sense  they  ve sold a lot of businesses  they  ve done most of the things they promised to do such as bring on new third party equipment financing and they  re going to bring on a new cfo as well

plunge says end is near at enron
by peter eavis
senior columnist
        pm est
enron  ene  nyse  news  commentary  research  analysis  shares plunged a second straight day wednesday as fear mounted that the struggling energy trader  s bailout merger plan will unravel 
a potentially lethal cash crunch appears to be gripping enron  even though its planned acquirer dynegy  dyn  nyse  news  commentary  research  analysis  has injected     billion of cash  and banks have opened new credit lines  an enron collapse would cause weeks of dislocation in the energy markets that would damage other energy traders  and it would cause big losses for the houston company  s creditors 
just before noon est  enron announced in a press release that it had extended to mid  december a   million obligation that was due next week  it also said that it had agreed with its bankers to draw down the remaining   million of a previously announced   billion secured credit line that has j  p  morgan chase as its lead banker 
investors have been fleeing enron since the company last month disclosed a     billion writedown to unwind some related  party hedging transactions  the securities and exchange commission is probing enron deals with related parties  the october disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested the company hadn  t been forthcoming about the true state of its finances  and it showed that enron was facing serious liquidity problems 
those fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when enron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival dynegy  but enron  s disclosure monday that it faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the exits  in the wednesday release  enron ceo ken lay said his company was still committed to the merger   we continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders  employees and lenders   dynegy later issued a press release indicating it is  continuing our confirmatory due diligence  regarding the merger  neither enron nor dynegy returned calls seeking comment 
after plunging   tuesday to      enron was down a staggering   at one point wednesday  it moved slightly higher after the midday press release to trade at      enron shares have lost more than   of their value since the company issued its third  quarter earnings release last month  dynegy dropped      to      though it remains substantially above premerger levels 
at the heart of enron  s trouble is the sense that the company isn  t letting on the full extent of its troubles  the selloff in enron shares began in earnest oct    when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call that it would take a     billion writedown to unwind some related  party transactions  critics of the company said those deals  in which the company did business with separate entities involving enron managers  raised serious ethical and disclosure issues 
the dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for enron  since as a big trading partner dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of enron  s situation  as a result  shares in both companies rallied after the deal  s announcement  but monday  s disclosure that enron faced   million in bond payments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges than it has detailed  according to a merrill lynch report cited in the new york times wednesday  dynegy wasn  t aware of the   million obligation  critics of the deal wondered whether enron had told dynegy about all its obligations

situation could worsen in a number of ways  
though enron  s most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal
situation  meade and smith characterized the information as  piecemeal  
 it appears that the full extent of enron  s problems is not currently
known   they said in a note  cautioning clients against investing in
enron
