bascially  we will need to spend another     million on    to keep the equipment orders alive 
the spreadsheet below may help 
the line  incremental cash spend  is what enron will need to pay at the end of each november and december  the line  cancellation  e  next interest  is enron  s cancellation exposure  binding commitment to the equipment vendors and e  next  to the extent we cancel on those dates

cancellation charges have been the focus because the cash is provided by e  next banks  turbopark   the cash paid to date is less than the actual contractual obligation to date  we do not need balance sheet cash to continue  but we need to come up with b  s cash if we terminate  hopefully the following clarifies 
cash payments to date 
ge  fa   
st 
hrsg 
interest 
total    
next payments 
ge  fa    nov 
st    dec 
hrsg    dec 
these are estimates  the timing of the actual payments depends upon when the vendor completes some of the work  payment based on milestones
cancellation charges 
      mm
      mm
        mm
each day from    to    the cancellation charge increases by approx   k
dash is based on contractual exposure  not cash out the door  hence the request at this time  in addition to looking for opportunities to sell the equipment and the project  we are looking into the st and hrsg contracts to make sure the vendors are not in any sort of breach

a termination of equipment associated with the longview project on or before      will require enron to write  off approximately   million  not inclusive of approximately   million in development costs to date 
to extend orders for equipment to      will cost an additional     million in cancellation charges 
to extend orders for equipment to      will cost an additional     million  inclusive of the     million above  therefore  net     million  in cancellation charges 
termination at any time between now and year  end  provides no material recovery potential for money spent
