 cpuc settles filed rate doctrine case with socal
 cpuc kills dwr rate agreement  davis may reconsider old senate bill
cpuc  socal suit
in a closed hearing today  the california public utilities commission voted    to settle its filed rate doctrine case with socal edison  the implications could save socal from an otherwise immanent bankruptcy  though bankruptcy remains a real threat  under the agreement  the cpuc has stipulated the following points  which have not yet been formalized by administrative law judge  ronald lew 
 the cpuc agrees to maintain a level of rates necessary for socal to pay off under  collect through  
 all surplus revenue  revenue above o  m  generated from any source must be applied to socal  s back debt 
 socal agrees to pay no dividends on its common stock from now until   or until all back debt has been recovered  if socal  s debt has not been recovered by   the cpuc will extend appropriate rates levels necessary for socal to recover its debt through   dividend payouts on socal common stock will be subject to cpuc approval during this extension 
   of any revenue socal receives  generates from ferc  generator refunds will be applied to socal  s debt 
 once socal  s back debt has been recovered  any surplus revenue generated from the cpuc rate hikes will be refunded to ratepayers 
cpuc  dwr rate agreement
the fact that the puc voted down the dwr rate agreement  by a    margin  puts governor davis and treasurer angelides in a very awkward position  this leaves senator burton  s bill  sb  xx  as the vehicle that sets to payment path for the revenue bonds to repay the general fund 
however  as late as this morning  governor davis vowed  through his spokesman  that sb  xx was  dead on arrival  and would be vetoed  this move by the puc puts pressure on davis to sign sb  xx in order to protect the bonds and the long  term power contacts he has negotiated 
however   xx violates the terms of a number of the long  term power contacts negotiated by the governor earlier this year  for example 
 sb  xx splits the revenue streams for payment of the general fund  s revenue bonds and payment to the dwr for power  it clarifies the funds that will go to repay the general fund  but is much less clear on the funds to pay the dwr for power  sb  xx leaves the long  term contracts signed by the governor open to review and renegotiation  something that the governor remains publicly unwilling to do 
 sb  xx also violates the terms of the bridge loan the state negotiated with shearson lehman earlier this year  the terms of the bridge loan explicitly state that if  xx is passed  the banks can accelerate the loan or impose penalty terms of interest on the state  these terms were suggested by the governor as a means of forcing the legislature to support his dwr rate agreement rather than burton  s  of course  this effort failed when the legislature easily passed sb  xx  today  s puc action further complicates the situation 
while on the surface this would seem to force the governor  s hand into signing sb  xx  that may not  in fact  happen  it would not be out of character for the governor to instead veto sb  xx  then force either the legislature or the puc to  play ball  with him in order to repay the general fund  thus  another leverage point has been created  we will continue to monitor the situation to attempt to determine the likelihood of davis signing or vetoing sb  xx
