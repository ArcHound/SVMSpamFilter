Subject fw  california update       
on friday  the assembly failed to get its version of the edison mou out of the appropriations committee 
the bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full assembly for passage 
negotiations continue among assembly democrats about what the final bill should look like 
the assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the assembly on tuesday 
in response to the california puc proposed order  which would retroactively end direct access on july   the assembly amended its bill on friday to include its own  date certain  for the temporary suspension of direct access 
the assembly bill would now suspend direct access beginning august  
we are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either   the date the bill is signed or   september  
we will provide additional information on tuesday about the bill  s status and our progress in changing the suspension date

the assembly will attempt to pass its version of the edison mou  sb   out of the appropriations committee today 
if and when that occurs  the assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full assembly today 
it will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today 
if and when the assembly gets the bill out of the assembly today  the bill will move over to the senate  where the chances of passage are even more remote 
that said  davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature 
will report back with the events of the assembly 
don  t hesitate to call if you have any questions
