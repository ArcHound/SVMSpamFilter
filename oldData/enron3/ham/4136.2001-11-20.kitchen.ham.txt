ees is fine with the org  chart below  i understand the     million is total for both ena  ees  comments 
   need a recommended split of the     million for ena  ees 
   i understand the     million includes   for outside services  the ooc of ena  ees needs to approve as these services are needed 
   the     million does include legacy real estate costs  jim fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs  is this on his radar screen 
   we need to reconcile what we do with steve montovano  because both ena  ees want to utilize him  i might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him  louise  jim  are you both ok with this  if so  rick  jim  i would suggest putting him in the ne gas box 
   rick  i understand you  re talking with kean  whalley on handling the washington office activity in corp  i agree
