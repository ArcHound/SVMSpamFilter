subject  re  enron  s secrets revealed
karen  i was out of town yesterday  and am just now getting your message  i will give you a call this morning to discuss  the thing that concerns me the most is the reference to  inside view       if they have not talked to anyone at enron  or don  t attribute the  inside view  to some credible former enron person  then it is misleading to call it an  inside view   absent false statements or breaches of confidentiality  if this is nothing more than someone  s opinion of enron and how it operates  then we probably can  t stop them  i  m surprised that there is not more of this  stuff    it would definately be helpful to get a copy of the report  even if we have to pay for it   without knowing what it says  it would be hard to say what action we can take  i will give you a call and we can discuss  thanks  rex
