fred mitro and i just got off the phone with duncan croasdale at enron canada regarding the  nls  he indicated that  although nothing has been signed yet  that they are working on several leads  steve thome  he works for calger  is also pursuing a lead on these units with montana power 
duncan advised me and fred that the units are on canada  s books for us   million  and the asking price is us     million 
i am happy to take these units on as you requested  fred mitro and chris booth in my group  who also worked on the successful lm  sales and pending ge  ea and sw  d  a sales  can be made available to work on a sale of these units  in my conversation with duncan  however  he indicated his group wants us to instead help to provide customer leads which we would turn over to them  we can certainly do this as an alternative to taking the units on directly 
please let me know how you would like us to proceed 
regards
