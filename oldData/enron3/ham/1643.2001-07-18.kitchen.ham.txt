subject  california update     
what people know 
hertzberg  et al  s  bill   xx  was heard in an  informational  hearing today and still sits in the assembly energy committee  it will be heard again tomorrow  perhaps beginning at  am   at which time parties will have a chance to support  oppose and ask for amendments  most  including us  oppose unless significantly amended 
the wright  d   richman  r  bill   xx  was heard in an  informational  hearing today and still sits in the assembly energy committee  it will be heard again tomorrow  at which time parties will have a chance to support  oppose and ask for amendments  from our perspective  this is the best bill out there yet  though it still has serious problems    it isn  t available electronically yet  but should be tomorrow  and i  ll distribute then  the chances of the joint d  r bill being successful are slim  however  since it  s up against the speakers competing bill  there is talk that the speaker will try to negotiate with wright  richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill   xx  
the original version of the governor  s mou bill sits in the senate  most believe that burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail 
the senate  s version of the mou  sher  peace  kuehl    xx  came out today  it will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day  notably  it kills direct access completely and makes edison shareholders responsible for that portion of edison  s debt owed to suppliers  in short  a very bad bill 
burton  s  xx  which would de  link the bond issuance  to pay back the general fund  from the dwr contracts is likely to pass the senate tomorrow or the next day  many   including enron   support the bill  though we are supporting it behind the scenes  
what people don  t know 
whether there  s the time or the will in the assembly and senate to achieve by friday a single  comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature 
whether the legislature would postpone its month  long recess if the legislature hasn  t finished a bill by friday  most folks think they will not postpone  
whether it  s true that  irrespective of the energy issue  the legislature will fail to get the budget completed by friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway  in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time 
odds  makers still say it  s better than    that the legislature does not get the edison bills done by friday and leaves on on its   day vacation
