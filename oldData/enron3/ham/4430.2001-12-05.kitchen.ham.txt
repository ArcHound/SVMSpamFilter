i  m not absolutely sure either  but i think she is saying they can provide a package that 
  provides it staff that will not leave  and can backfill any attrition we may see 
  provide cash for us to use as we see fit  i  e  retention  using our existing hardware assets as collateral 
  help with any future integration work with the potential newco buyers  apparantly she knows who they are and they use ibm also  and she has contacts there  
  use ibm  s name to help in anyway that may make the venture more likely to succeed
