janelle and i met this morning regarding the churn for ecso    et al 
in order to be able to meet the deadline of next weekend  we will have to have all churns submitted no later than monday  january      pm  we will not be able to allow any adds  changes past that point 
should we be unable to meet the deadline at    on monday we will need to look at pushing back a week  one option might be  if all churns aren  t submitted on time  to move all non ubs people off of ecs    on the    weekend  and then  shuffle  every eon else the following
thanks  call me if you have any questions
