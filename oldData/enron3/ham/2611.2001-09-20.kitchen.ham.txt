subject  sundance b bid from duke
john  louise  rob 
i thought i would fire off a quick note to inform you that duke produced a non  binding bid for the entire sundance b ppa  duke  s bid is c        this compares to an earlier bid of c       to c       for one unit on july     duke  s bid combined with the cost structure of the ppa would have duke buying the ppa for approximately c      mw or us      mw 
the mark  to  market value of both the sundance units as of september  th  s curves was c        therefore  a sale to duke at c   mm would not provide any significant increase to earnings  additionally  it must be noted that the curves have some very conservative heat rate assumptions built into to the latter years 
based on a conversation with john last week  he clearly indicated that selling the ppa for under us      mw is not acceptable  i would agree with john that enron would better be served by maintaining its current position than accept a bid reflecting a price less than us      it must be noted that duke  s bid expires at    pm cdt  september   therefore  if anyone feels strongly that we should move forward with duke we should address it immediately  otherwise  don miller and i continue to position enron for the division of the ppa and subsequent auction
