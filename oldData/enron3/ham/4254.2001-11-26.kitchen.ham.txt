with the stock market telling dynegy inc  that energy trader enron corp  isn  t worth even half what dynegy has offered to pay  analysts and investors are paying close attention to the circumstances under which dynegy could bargain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal 
earlier this month  houston  based dynegy offered to buy its far larger cross  town rival in an all  stock deal that currently values enron shares at     apiece  or a total of about     billion  but in the wake of post  agreement disclosures by enron that its future earnings are likely to be substantially less than expected  the company  s stock has been hammered  in  p  m  trading on the new york stock exchange on friday  enron shares fell  cents to      the stock is down   so far this year and far short of the per  share takeover price  dynegy shares rose  cents to     
although dynegy and enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under the terms negotiated  dynegy does appear to have other options  the agreement with enron contains a broad  material adverse change  clause as well as some specific trigger points that could be invoked 
dynegy officials performed  due diligence  throughout the holiday weekend  seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of enron  which has suffered a series of damaging blows  since mid  october  enron has disclosed that some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved assets off enron  s balance sheet  for a time  to several private partnerships  those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation  past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an  accounting error  by enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since oct    at one point  enron restated downwards nearly five years of earnings 
an enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the deal would be completed as agreed  dynegy spokesman john sousa said the two sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk  away provisions  are broad  by design  to ensure adequate protection for dynegy shareholders   shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreement 
clauses related to a  material adverse change   also known as a  material adverse effect   have been the focus of much attention among merger professionals this year  due  in part  to the stock market  s fluctuations and the economic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisitions 
but such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are considered extremely difficult to prove  both parties typically are reluctant to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal  much the way a bride and groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins 
furthermore  a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views that a buyer can  t easily walk away from a merger  in that case  meat  processing concern tyson foods inc  sought to cancel a planned acquisition of meat  packer ibp inc  due to a drop in ibp  s earnings and a write  down of an ibp subsidiary  but a delaware judge refused to let tyson cancel the pact  saying tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of ibp  s business and the accounting issue 
in a lengthy june  opinion  delaware chancery court vice chancellor leo e  strine jr  wrote that     the important thing is whether the company has suffered a material adverse effect in its business or results of operations that is consequential to the company  s earnings power over a commercially reasonable period  which one would think would be measured in years rather than months  
that interpretation has created ripples in the deal  making community  prompting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under which deals can be terminated  since the sept   attacks  for example  a handful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity would qualify as a  material adverse change   or mac 
a key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change is  whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is it just a hiccup   says meredith brown  co  chairman of the mergers and acquisitions group at law firm debevoise  plimpton in new york  he adds that a court  may be skeptical  if dynegy claimed that enron  s post  merger agreement disclosures were a surprise 
the enron  dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting either side to seek termination  enron can quit the deal if it receives a substantially better offer  although it is prohibited from soliciting one  in such a case  it could be required to pay a   million  topper fee  to dynegy and its co  investor  chevrontexaco inc 
dynegy can alter the deal if enron faces  pending or threatened  litigation liabilities that are  reasonably likely  to cost enron   billion  if those liabilities hit     billion  an enron material event will be deemed to have occurred   presumably allowing dynegy to call the whole thing off  in some situations  dynegy would be liable for a   million fee  as well 
karen denne  the enron spokeswoman  said her firm doesn  t believe that losses arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material event  the liability must result from litigation  currently  the company faces more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by officers and directors  issuing false and misleading reports and other offenses 
deal makers who aren  t involved in the combination say the steep drop in enron  s stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn  t by itself give dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force enron to renegotiate its terms  instead  they say  dynegy would likely have to prove that enron  s worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event  which could be difficult in light of the company  s highly publicized problems and dynegy  s frequent statement that it clearly understands enron  s businesses  still  there is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow dynegy to terminate the deal if  any representation or warranty of enron shall have become untrue  
other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in stock prices that changed an acquisition premium  western resources inc  of topeka  kansas last week sued public service co  of new mexico seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy western  s utilities  the lawsuit accused public service of breaching its  duty of good faith and fair dealing  and said the new mexico company tried to  sabotage  the deal as the two companies  stock prices diverged  public service denies the accusations

it  s not easy being no    despite a   billion merger completed in october  chevrontexaco corp  is still not one of the oil superpowers  nor  at more than   billion a year in revenues  is it a scrappy little guy  so chairman david j  o  reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drilling for more oil and gas 
now  he may have something  a big stake in the no   energy  trading company  chevron corp  has owned   of dynegy inc  since   and with dynegy  s planned acquisition of enron corp   the top energy trader  chevrontexaco is making the oil industry  s most aggressive push yet into this fast  growing business  it plans to eventually pump     billion into the combined dynegy and enron to maintain its   stake  and it might raise that share  so  while chevrontexaco  s much bigger rivals run small in  house trading operations  energy trading may soon account for more than   of chevrontexaco  s earnings    chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business    says analyst arjun murti at goldman  sachs the most likely target is a natural  gas company  maybe it  s not so bad being no

as houston  based enron corp  imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its finances  few would have blamed dynegy inc  ceo charles l  watson if he had sat back and gloated  after all  watson had watched as his bigger  brasher crosstown rival sniffed at dynegy  s more cautious strategy  all the while garnering most of the credit for reshaping the energy  trading business 
instead  watson picked up the phone on oct   and called enron chairman  ceo  and longtime acquaintance kenneth l  lay to ask how he could help  lay didn  t respond immediately  but as enron  s stock continued to plunge and the company faced a cash squeeze  it became clear what the only realistic answer could be  bail us out 
so two days later  lay invited watson to his river oaks home near downtown houston for breakfast to discuss a deal  over muffins and   a bad cup of coffee   the next day  watson recalls  they sketched the outlines  and by  p  m  that night  the investment bankers were called in  on nov    dynegy announced that it would pay about   billion  plus the assumption of   billion in debt  to buy enron  which is nearly four times its size  the key to the deal was dynegy  s immediate     billion infusion of cash to shore up enron  s balance sheet and save its credit rating  the money came from dynegy  s   owner  chevrontexaco corp 
without that help  enron   the seventh  largest u  s  company  based on its   billion in sales last year   may well have faced bankruptcy  watson says that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams    i don  t think anybody foresaw the problems  at enron     he says    it  s been incredible to watch   
watson    has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment yet  if he can pull it off  the new dynegy will have revenues of more than   billion and   billion in assets  including more than    megawatts of power  generating capacity and    miles of pipeline  it would control an estimated   to   of the energy  trading market  up from about   now 
that would be sweet vindication for watson  s strategy  dynegy backs trading operations with hard assets such as power plants  which allows the company to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer  in contrast  enron has worked furiously to shed power plants and oil  and gas  generating fields  believing it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expertise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel  pulp  and paper  irresistible bargain  as enron  s stock slid below   from its august    high of    it became a bargain that watson couldn  t pass up  it would have taken years for dynegy to build up a market  making operation to match enron  s  its risk  management systems are top  of  the  line  enron  s commercial  services unit  which manages power supplies for corporate customers such as wendy  s international inc   is three or four years ahead of dynegy  s  says steve bergstrom  president of dynegy  watson says he still plans to get rid of the   billion worth of assets lay had earmarked for sale  including the portland  ore   general electric plant and oil and gas assets in india  for the     billion  though  if the deal falls through dynegy will have the right to enron  s prized northern natural gas pipeline  worth an estimated     billion  and dynegy can walk away if enron  s legal liabilities exceed     billion 
watson firmly believes that enron suffered from a crisis of confidence  not a meltdown of its core business  indeed  enron  s wholesale  trading operation earned     billion last year  says watson    we know the business  we looked under the hood  and guess what  it  s just as strong as we thought it was   
but the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by enron  s accounting tricks  the biggest danger for watson is that there are other time bombs ticking away  already  the company has slashed its reported earnings since  by   million  or   of its total  to account for controversial partnerships involving enron officials  the securities some compare it to a fraternity  dynegy  s decision to issue new stock options to some enron employees may soothe battered egos  it should help  too  that lay decided not to take the   million golden parachute he could have received in a buyout  as it is  lay will not have a management job with the new company 
dynegy often seemed to be an enron wannabe  following it into online trading and commercial services  still  dynegy  s   stock gains last year eclipsed enron  s   rise  and it rankled some that lay  s execs got more credit    chuck watson may not have been in the spotlight  but he has always been at the forefront of this business    says bruce m  withers  who sold his trident ngl inc  to dynegy in   watson will get more attention next year   he  s a   owner of the new houston texans pro football team  but with his bold takeover of enron  watson has ensured that he  s off the sidelines for good

confused about earnings  you  re not alone  here  s what companies should do   and what investors need to know

in an age when giant earnings write  offs have become commonplace  it  s hard to shock wall street  but on nov    enron corp  managed to do it  after years of high  octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to   a year  the houston  based energy company acknowledged that results for the past three years were actually overstated by more than a half  billion dollars  it was confirmation of investors  worst fears  three weeks earlier  enron had announced a big drop in shareholders  equity  sparking fears that its hideously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance  management pointed to a number of factors  including a dubious decision to exclude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a billion  dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company  s net worth 
enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far short of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases  but it is hardly alone  this year  corporate america is expected to charge off a record   billion  much of it for assets  investments  and inventory that aren  t worth as much as management thought  chart  page    even if companies don  t go back and restate earnings  as enron is doing  those charges cast doubt on the record  breaking earnings growth of the late   s 
not since the  s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issue   and so difficult for investors to determine  there  s more at stake than the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers  if even the most sophisticated financial minds can  t figure out what a company actually earns  that has implications far beyond enron  u  s  financial markets have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build  it has made the u  s  the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place to invest  it has also ensured ready access to capital for u  s  corporations  that a company such as enron  a member of the standard  poor  s   stock index and one of the largest companies on the new york stock exchange  could fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnished    the profession of auditing and accounting is  in fact  in crisis    says paul a  volcker  former chairman of the federal reserve and now one of the leaders of the international accounting standards board 
sometimes  as in the case of enron  fuzzy numbers result from questionable decisions in figuring net earnings  more often  though  the earnings chaos results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in their own idiosyncratic ways   and an increasing willingness among investors and analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies  which appear under a variety of names  from   pro forma   to   core     enron offers its own such version  before investors untangled the importance of enron  s first announcement  its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its   recurring net income   had met expectations   the resulting murk makes it difficult to answer the most basic question in investing  what did my company earn 
why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place  because the numbers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles  gaap  are woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a company  s prospects  many institutional investors  most wall street analysts  and even many accountants say gaap is irrelevant    i don  t know anyone who uses gaap net income anymore for anything    says lehman brothers inc  accounting expert robert willens  the problem is that gaap includes a lot of noncash charges and one  time expenses  while investors need to be aware of those charges  they also need a number that pertains solely to the performance of ongoing operations 
that  s what operating earnings are supposed to do  but because they  re calculated in an ad hoc manner  with each company free to use its own rules  comparisons between companies have become meaningless    no investor   certainly not any ordinary investor   can read these in a way that  s useful    says harvey l  pitt  chairman of the securities  exchange commission  the sec is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and perhaps restrict use of pro formas 
what  s badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings and a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income  in the end  investors need two numbers   a standardized operating number and an audited net  income number   and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the other    out of hand    a widespread consensus is building to do just that  in early november  s  p proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when tallying operating earnings  only the week before  the financial accounting standards board  the rulemakers for gaap  had announced that they  too  would be taking up this issue  volcker says the international accounting standards board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings 
  over the past two or three years  the use of creative earnings measures has grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of hand    says david m  blitzer  s  p  s chief investment strategist    earnings are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they  re trying to evaluate a company  if people want to use an operating  earnings measure  we better all know what we  re looking at   
without those standards in place  the gap between earnings according to generally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to wall street is only going to grow wider and more confusing  look at the variance in earnings per share calculated for the s  p  for the third quarter  it  s     according to wall street analysts as tallied by thomson financial  first call      according to s  p  and     according to numbers reported to the sec under gaap   s  p  like businessweek  is owned by the mcgraw  hill companies  
the lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong  use first call  s earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively modest price  earnings ratio of  for the s  p   but run the numbers using gaap earnings  and suddenly the market has a far steeper p  e of  
how did we get into this mess  investors and analysts have been calculating operating earnings for years  and for years  reasonable people could more or less agree on how to do it  then came the dot  com bubble  along with increased pressure from wall street for companies to meet their quarterly earnings forecasts  suddenly  companies that hadn  t turned a profit by any conventional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants  these customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and allowed upstart companies to show a profit    tower of babel    pro forma formulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within the same company  casting doubt on their validity  and these days  the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever  s  p  s tallies fall between the two  s  p  s numbers are more systematic than pro forma  but they aren  t followed widely enough to be a standard    investors are facing a tower of babel    says robert k  elliott  former chief of the american institute of certified public accountants  aicpa  and a retired kpmg partner    it  s not standardized  and the numbers are not audited   
that makes it tough to evaluate a company  s performance  in the quarter ended on sept    nortel networks corp  offered shareholders at least three earnings numbers to choose from  by conservative gaap accounting  the telecommunications giant lost     a share  the company also provided two possible pro forma options  a  cents loss that excluded   special charges    including some acquisition costs and restructuring charges  and a still better  cents loss that further excluded     billion of   incremental charges    such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivables  wall street chose the rosiest one 
confusing  you bet  companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointing out that they  re merely filling a void  investors are clamoring for a measure that gives them better insight into their company  s future  the goal is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for those operations    there are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operating earnings    says volcker    it is an effort to provide some continuity and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company    besides  as companies like to point out  they still have to report gaap earnings  and investors are free to ignore everything else 
there  s no starker lesson in the shortcomings of gaap than the   billion asset write  downs by jds uniphase corp   the biggest charge of the year  near the height of the telecom bull market in july    the san jose  calif   maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor sdl inc  for   billion in stock  when the deal closed in february  its assets ballooned from   billion to   billion  but by then  shares of jds and other fiber  optics makers were collapsing  to bring its acquisitions into line with their new value  the company took charges of   billion  despite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions and involved no cash paid  gaap required that the charges be taken out of net income  so according to gaap  jds lost   billion in the fiscal year ending in june   a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past five years added up to only   billion 
analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash  the charge  off was all about the past  a right  sizing of values that had gotten out of hand  to analyze the company  s prospects  they excluded the   billion charge    the accounting is not designed to make things look better but to describe what happened    says jds uniphase chief financial officer anthony r  muller    and we  ll live with the consequences  whatever they are    analysts make a similar defense    my goal is to figure out what the business is going to produce so that we can value the company    says lehman brothers analyst arnab chanda  glacial pace  are jds  s pro forma numbers realistic   a fair gauge of jds  s ongoing operations  right now  it  s hard for investors to judge  and that  s the kind of ambiguity s  p and others would like to eliminate  in november  s  p circulated a memo on how to standardize operating earnings  under the proposal  operating earnings would include the costs of purchases  research and development  restructuring costs  including severance   write  downs from ongoing operations  and the cost to the company of stock options  it would exclude merger  and  acquisition expenses  impairment of goodwill  litigation settlements  and the gain or loss on the sale of an asset 
when s  p applied roughly that formula to jds uniphase  it split the difference between wall street and gaap  because of differences in what each group included in their earnings calculations  the results were chaotic  using gaap  the company lost     a share  s  p figures it lost      while the company put the loss at  cents  meanwhile  wall street says it made  cents 
the s  p standard may make sense  but it raises the question  where is the financial accounting standards board  the group in charge of gaap  chairman edmund l  jenkins says fasb will be addressing the problems  still  investors shouldn  t expect any improvement soon  the pace of change at fasb tends to be glacial  it typically takes four years to complete a new standard  in   for example  the board realized that standards on restructuring charges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda  in june    the board finally issued a draft of a new standard  asked for comments  and held a public hearing  in october    the board said it still wasn  t ready to put a fix in place  now  the recession has set off another wave of restructuring charges  and the fasb still doesn  t have new rules 
the slow pace means the standard  setters sometimes fail to react to sudden changes in the market  the most recent failure followed the terrorist attacks on september   an fasb task force  unable to come up with a set of rules for separating september  costs from general expenses  instead told companies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item  so gaap earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a company  s general performance  many companies have nevertheless broken those costs out in their unaudited press releases 
many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter  indeed   is shaping up to be one for the record books  a poor economy and the devastating aftereffects of september  have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that are unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen  but there  s a growing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one  time charges  the temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now  while investors are braced for bad news  not only can managers sweep away yesterday  s errors  but tomorrow  s earnings will look even better 
the basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense   a charge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to distort the truth about a company  s performance  usually  big charges fall into a few categories  including charges for laying off workers and restructuring a company  charges for assets that have lost value since they were purchased  charges for investments that have lost value  and charges for inventory that has become obsolete  in a recent study  harvard business school professor mark t  bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling these charges unusual  that gives them a rationale for excluding them from their pro forma calculations 
lots of critics disagree  saying such charges are often an inevitable part of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company  s earnings history  they certainly should not be ignored by investors    charges are real shareholder wealth that  s been lost    argues david w  tice  manager of the prudent bear fund  a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that  s up   so far this year    it  s money they spent on something no longer worth what it was  a correction of past earnings  or a reserve for costs moving forward  whatever the reason  it  s a real cost to the company  and that hurts shareholders    without standards  excessive write  offs from operating earnings can obscure actual performance  without any rules  companies calculate operating earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best possible light  dell computer corp  is a good example of this   heads i win  tails you lose   school of accounting  for years  dell benefited from gains in its venture  capital investments and was happy to include those gains in its reported earnings  where they appeared as a separate line on the income statement  but this year  when those gains turned to losses  the computer maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that   million drag  dell spokesman michael maher says the company  s press releases and sec filings break out investment income and give gaap numbers as well as pro forma    in our view  the numbers are reported clearly    says maher    it  s all out there for the consuming public    past puffery  many experts believe special charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated  what should investors make of a company such as gateway inc   two restructuring charges in the first and third quarters  minus a small extraordinary gain  totaled     billion  or about   million more than the company made in     and  combined  which is the truer picture of its performance and potential  the write  offs or the earnings  write  offs for customer financing are another example  when nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to customers by   million in september  it effectively admitted it had booked sales in the past to companies that couldn  t pay   in effect overstating its performance in those earlier periods  in addition  nortel says booking sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues  tech companies blame the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write  offs  and these aren  t isolated examples  peter l  bernstein  publisher of newsletter economics  portfolio strategy  found that from  to     of earnings vanished into write  offs 
big charge  offs can also distort future performance  critics contend that excess reserves are often used as a sort of   cookie jar   from which earnings can be taken in future quarters to meet wall street  s expectations  or charges taken this year  for example  which is apt to be a lousy one for most companies anyway  might include costs that would otherwise have been taken in future periods  prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earnings  rules for figuring operating earnings would help  but this is an area that will always involve a certain amount of judgment   and therefore invite a certain amount of abuse    people are going to write off everything they can in the next two quarters because they  re having a bad year anyway    says robert g  atkins  a mercer management consultant 
part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug them off  believing that with the bad news out in the open  the company is poised for a brighter future  since gateway detailed its third  quarter charge of   million on oct    wall street has bid the stock up    compared with a   runup for the s  p  
often  though  investors should take exactly the opposite message  if  for example  part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training  information  technology spending  or research and development  the cuts could depress future performance  says baruch lev  a professor of accounting at the stern school of business at new york university    are these really one  time events    he asks    or is this the beginning of an avalanche    indeed  morgan stanley dean witter  co  strategist steve galbraith has found that in the year following a big charge  off to earnings companies have underperformed the stock market by  percentage points    la la land    investors are apt to be faced with more huge write  offs next year  even if the economy doesn  t continue to worsen  why  the transition to a new gaap rule that changes the way companies account for goodwill   a balance  sheet asset that reflects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangible assets  under the new rule  companies will have to assess their properties periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value falls  an informal survey by financial executives international of its member controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect to take more charges 
but figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task  unless there is a comparable company or factory with an established market price  valuing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules    what this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors coming up with their own tests for impairment    says the stern school  s professor paul r  brown    it  s la la land   
while the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings games  it could also be an impetus for change   especially in the wake of the dot  com fiasco  indeed  there are some signs of a backlash  the real estate investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings  with its   funds from operations    or ffo  but now some reits have begun to revert to plain old gaap earnings  hamid r  moghadam  ceo of san francisco  based amb property corp   shifted back to gaap in     the reason i don  t like ffo is very simple    says moghadam    one company  s numbers look better than another one  s even if they had identical fundamental results   
there are other steps fasb could take to improve financial reporting and restore gaap  s status  trevor s  harris  an accounting expert at morgan stanley  says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income from operations and income from financial transactions  lehman  s willens says companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they bear on earnings  an easy step would be to require companies to file their press releases with the sec 
at the least  says lev  companies must clearly explain how their pro forma numbers relate to the gaap numbers  otherwise  he says  investors   see numbers floating there  and where did they come from    in today  s environment of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write  offs  no question is more important to investors 
high  gloss glossary
companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin on
their results  here  s what those terms mean 
defining earnings 
net income
the bottom line  according to generally accepted accounting principles  gaap  
sometimes called   reported earnings    these are the numbers the securities 
exchange commission accepts in its filings 
operating earnings
an adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrelated
to the ongoing business  although it sounds deceptively like a gaap figure
called   operating income    revenue minus the costs of doing business   it is
not an audited figure 
core earnings
another term for operating earnings  neither core nor operating earnings are
calculated according to set rules  they can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes 
pro forma earnings
the  s term for operating earnings  popularized by dot  coms  it sometimes
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest 
ebitda
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  the
granddaddy of pro forma  it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads  such as cable tv  but has since come to be widely
quoted 
adjusted earnings
a new term for pro forma 
defining costs 
special charges
a general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and
therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections 
asset impairments
charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to its
current market value  many companies are now taking these charges on internal
venture  capital funds that bought internet and other high  tech stocks at
inflated prices 
goodwill impairments
the same idea as asset impairments except they  re used to write down the
premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible assets
acquired  these charges will explode in the first quarter of  because of a
change in mergers  and  acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill
amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair values 
restructuring reserves
an accrued expense  not usually cash  to cover future costs of closing down a
portion of a business  a plant  or of firings  these are projected costs and
if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed 
write  down
lowering the value of an asset  such as a plant or stock investment  it is
often excused as a bookkeeping exercise  but there may have been a real cost
long ago that now proves ill spent  or there may have been associated cash
costs  such as investment  banking fees

what did the company earn  that  s the most basic question an investor can ever ask  the equity culture that has generated so much growth over the years depends on a clear answer  but getting one has become impossible  enron corp  just announced that its earnings for the past three years were overstated by half a billion dollars  how did one of the biggest companies on the new york stock exchange manage to inflate its earnings by   without auditors  analysts  ratings agencies  and the business press  businessweek included  discovering it  in part  blame the breakdown of standardized accounting rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of corporate america  the u  s  needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a clear picture of financial performance  without integrity in financial reporting  the u  s  cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the global marketplace  page   
the dot  com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriously wrong with accounting standards  companies without much of a business model customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expenses in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations  wall street conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in  soon  the method of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within a company  it is now chaos 
a stricter adherence to accounting rules won  t solve the entire problem  gaap  the generally accepted accounting principles  allow all kinds of one  time expenses and noncash charges  this obscures the performance of ongoing operations  no one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense  the result is total confusion  take earnings per share for the standard  poor  s   stock index for the second quarter  under thomson financial  first call standards  it is      but it  s     according to s  p and     under gaap  how can investors make intelligent decisions 
the financial accounting standards board clearly is failing to do its job  it has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings and relates them to net earnings  but it hasn  t delivered  the rating agency standard  poor  s  owned by the mcgraw  hill companies  as is businessweek  is doing a better job  it recently drew up a definition of   operating earnings   that includes restructuring costs  including severance   writedowns from ongoing operations  and the cost of stock options  it excludes merger and acquisition expenses  litigation settlements  impairment of goodwill  and gains or losses on asset sales  this is a beginning that fasb should build on  the accounting anarchy has to end

companies  finance international  enron still optimistic of averting financial meltdown

enron said yesterday it was still expecting outside investors to inject   m to   bn into the group  as talks continued to avoid a financial meltdown at the energy trading group 
dynegy  whose rescue bid for its houston rival is crucial to enron  s survival  spent last week  s thanksgiving holiday and the weekend reviewing enron  s operations and finances 
dynegy said it remained  optimistic for the potential of the merger to be completed  and in the time  frame we originally announced  six to nine months  
enron  s fate depends on a delicate  unofficial pact between its lenders  dynegy  and credit ratings agencies  which have resisted downgrading the group  s debt while the deal is pending 
if the pact stays in place  at least   m is likely to be invested in enron by jp morgan chase and citigroup  enron  s key lenders and advisers  a further   m is being sought from private equity firms 
but if dynegy pulls out of the deal  the cash infusion could be put in jeopardy and the ratings agencies could downgrade the debt to junk  triggering debt repayments across a network of partnerships and off  balance  sheet vehicles linked to enron 
enron confirmed yesterday that it was still seeking additional liquidity from new equity investors  but would not discuss their identities 
enron  s crisis of confidence became more acute last week when the shares fell from   to     following a regulatory filing that revealed the extent of the group  s debt burden 
completion of a   bn secured credit line from jpm chase and citigroup  and the postponement of a   m notes repayment due tomorrow were not sufficient to prop up the share price  the bonds also fell to levels consistent with a potential bankruptcy filing 
the slide in the share price has encouraged speculation that dynegy is preparing to renegotiate its all  stock bid  now worth     bn  compared with enron  s market value of     bn

schwab chief  s main theme  diversification

new york   more than two months after the sept   terrorist attacks  many investors remain edgy  but the stock market  after an initial selloff  has shown remarkable resilience 
few observers expect stock  market volatility to subside soon  still  experts say that now  more than ever  is the time for skittish investors to keep their wits about them 
in a recent interview  charles r  schwab  chairman and co  chief executive of charles schwab  co   the san francisco  based online and discount brokerage firm  gave his views on what investors should be doing   and what mistakes they should avoid 
here are some excerpts from the interview 
in the wake of the sept   attacks  how much more risk  if any  do you think is in the financial markets  or do you think it  s just that people  s perceptions about risk have changed 
i  ve been investing since   and i have to say that  year after year  the risk hasn  t changed  the risk is always there  there  s risk in investing in stocks  bonds and even u  s  treasuries because of interest  rate  fluctuations   there  s risk in real estate  too 
so the question is  how do you handle it  the best way is to diversify  over a long period of time  people who diversify their investments do pretty darned well  when they don  t    sometimes it  s fatal  if the only stock an investor owned was enron    or cisco at   that was pretty fatal 
what do you say to people who say they  re too scared to invest right now  that because of the threat of terrorism  the anthrax scares  the war in afghanistan  the recession  and so forth  there  s just too much uncertainty in the markets 
i remember back during the cuban missile crisis  we all feared the worst  we were all building bomb shelters  it was a scary time  this terrorist thing is no different  it  s awful   particularly for our children  but this country is so wealthy  in terms of its resources  intellectual capital and the strength of our government 
there is no more uncertainty today than in times past  for example  we  ve had many recessions  it  s not fun  especially when you begin reading about all these layoffs  in fact  i think the unemployment rate  now at      pretty easily might get to     before it gets better  and it probably won  t get better until march or april  also  the stock market will go up  hopefully before the economy goes up 
there  s   trillion sitting in money  market accounts  that  s a huge resource and buying power that  s definitely available for new investments 
what do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past two or so months 
they let their emotions take over  with the fear that people had  they didn  t use their rational thinking  they used their emotional thinking   after sept     they sold at the low  and fear was the driver 
just a year and a half ago  the driving emotion was greed  you  re not going to avoid this stuff  so the issue is how you manage through these cycles of fear and greed  even when i  m fearful of something  i say to myself   this is still the time to invest  
my biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say   i just don  t want to be in the stock market at all   and it  s just the time that people should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio 
some other mistakes  a lot of people hang on to the stock that was the poster child of the last cycle  or people say   i  ll get back in  the market  when i see the economy turn around   well  by the time they see that  it  s too late  they will have missed the whole ride back up

enron pursuing a cash infusion energy  company is seeking as much as   billion as it tries to shore up its endangered acquisition by dynegy

houston   enron corp  said talks are continuing with potential investors for an infusion of as much as   billion as the biggest energy trader tries to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by dynegy inc 
an investment would ease concern that enron  s weakened finances may prompt dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction  which is valued at   billion in stock and assumed debt 
enron is seeking an additional   million to   billion in cash but wouldn  t divulge details   we are not going to discuss the particulars of who we are talking to   enron spokeswoman karen denne said sunday 
shares of the houston company fell by   in the last three trading sessions on the new york stock exchange  at friday  s closing price of      the stock sells for less than half the     that dynegy is slated to pay in the acquisition  that  s a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will go through as planned 
enron is likely to have approached kohlberg  kravis roberts  co   blackstone group and carlyle group for a private equity investment  said industry analyst david snow of  net 
the firms have declined to comment 
in a conference call nov    enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to receive   million to   billion from those sources 
on wednesday  enron got a three  week reprieve from lenders on a    million note due this week  gaining more time to restructure its finances  dynegy chief executive chuck watson said he was  encouraged  by the commitment to extend the note payment as well as the closing of a    million credit facility  he said dynegy remained committed to the purchase 
enron already received     billion in cash nov   from chevrontexaco inc  as part of the dynegy buyout agreement  in return  dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an enron unit that owns the northern natural gas co  pipeline  under the deal  s terms  if dynegy and enron fail to merge  dynegy can acquire the pipeline company 
but barron  s reported over the weekend that dynegy  s right to the pipeline might be challenged by j  p  morgan chase  co  and salomon smith barney inc   which accepted the asset as collateral for   billion in loans to enron 
dynegy spokesman john sousa declined to comment on enron  s attempts to secure financing or whether more cash for enron is a condition of keeping the merger alive 
enron  s dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investigation of the company  which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratings cut 
the company said in a securities and exchange filing a week ago that it has less than   billion in cash and credit lines left

business standard

copyright  c  business standard
enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in risk management  it put in systems to manage risks on a real  time basis and had very strong management   james lam  founder of erisk  a consulting firm 
as an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of management of price risks  i have been an admirer of enron  s elaborate disclosure of its risk management practices  and yet  in a cascade of events over a period of just three weeks from mid  october  it lost two  thirds of its share value  became the subject of a us securities exchange commission  sec  investigation  and was taken over by a rival a third in size   latest reports create some doubt about whether this will go through   what went wrong 
no  the events had nothing to do with dabhol  indeed  if  for us in india  enron will always be associated with the controversial power project  elsewhere it is likely become a case study for students of accounting  finance and general management   on second thoughts  even its indian adventures would make an excellent case study  
but first  a recount of what happened  after announcing on october   without much explanation or transparency  that it has taken a charge of     billion against equity  enron  s share price started tumbling  apparently  the charge was the result of some financial transactions  and the sec launched an investigation  the chief financial officer  cfo   who was directly involved with the transactions  the company  s treasurer and a couple of other senior officials were sacked 
perhaps most damagingly  enron revised its accounts from  onwards  reducing profits by about   million and increasing debt by a somewhat similar amount  as a result  enron  s credit rating was downgraded 
it seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas trading  but in its investment activities controlled by the cfo  these comprised private equity  and enron  s share in each of the investee companies was kept artificially below  per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts  to this end  outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in enron itself  should the value of the investee company  ies  fall below agreed threshold  s  
all this was done to keep the losses in investments off  balance sheet  and mitigate their impact on reported profits  many other us corporations including j p morgan chase  which had large private equity investments  have suffered on this score  see world money october    enron wanted to avoid this and  last year  paid its since  dismissed cfo   million for his creative accounting genius 
incidentally  those enamoured of us gaap and its alleged superiority over the rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by the company  s auditors one of the big five firms  which was paid   million as audit fees and   million for other services by enron last year 
the restatement of the accounts from  onwards became necessary as the enron management  board and the auditors were forced  on review  to admit that at least some of the transactions should have been on  rather than off  balance sheet  details of all the transactions in question are yet to come out  but what has come out is bad enough 
but this apart  a billion dollar hit for a company of the size    billion  or cash flow    billion  of enron is  by itself  hardly a death warrant  but it turned out to be just that for enron 
perhaps because it was too arrogant  perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors  confidence was always somewhat fragile 
but there are two other points worth noting  the professionalism of equity analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between trading and producing  as for the first  the professional analysts were surely aware of the opaqueness of the accounts  but few questioned the management aggressively on the subject  perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified the spirit of the times trading assets was what the  masters of the universe  did  not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars  the enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal activity of trading in power and gas  with skilling  the former ceo  claming that  we are on the side of angels  we are taking on the entrenched monopolies  we are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world    the quotation is from an interview in businessweek  prior to skilling  s inglorious exit from enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst  
for the analysts  there was also safety in numbers  skilling claimed that  enron  s operations are built around the integration of modern financial technologies and physical technologies   bringing derivatives theory to trading in power and gas  obviously  the fate of long term capital management has not led to more sober management of trading risks 
surely the role of  markets  should be to reduce the distance  and cost  between producer and consumer  one does feel that there is something perverse in a society that values  in terms of compensation  the trader  don  t forget this is just a euphemism for the speculator  over the producer whether in the bond  currency or power and gas markets  the markets and  indeed  greed obviously have a role to play  but surely the pendulum needs to swing a little bit to the left
