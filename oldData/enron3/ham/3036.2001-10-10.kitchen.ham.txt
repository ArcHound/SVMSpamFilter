walter koffer  transmission
most of walter koffer  s work is for the east  but wayne pays for him because 
 the other transmission people are part of wayne  s world 
 west occassionally borrows people from virgo    person for two weeks   people  hours a day for  months  etc   and uses approximately one person  year 
this totals  people for the west  one less than a moth ago  kraszewski already left the company   no one else should be charged to the west  the west should not be used for arguing the existence of other technical people in the east  my budget will show  people for tech services which means that i intend to reduce by one more  likely to occur in ql
