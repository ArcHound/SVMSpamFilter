jez our concerns are not just an internal approval issue  under australian law the directors of ecappl need to be satisfied when a company incurs a debt that it can be paid  failure to discharge this duty can mean the directors would be personally for the debt  if the coal group is comfortable to make to enter into these commitments then that is the obvious way forward  one of the coal group in the sydney office  presumably paul mcphee  could replace heidi mason as resident director

we seem to be going round in circle  s here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this e  mail so we can resolve swiftly  this cargo is due to be shipped in seven days with the coal already being railed to port  it is coal which will be shipped to service european commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account  including financing   needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world  last but not least we will need to look elsewhere to procure coal for these european sales at what is likely to be a higher price 
appreciate the green light 
thks

it has been made clear to me that jeff shankman needs to clear this transaction through bill bradford and louise kitchen prior to any capital going out the door  it is my understanding that this has not been done

details on the cargo we are loading out of newcastle  sailing time is roughly  days  cargo to be sold to ara  german customers  most with payment terms  days post delivery  also  it would help to get an idea of how diificult this exercise will be in the coming months  as we have a couple more loading before year end 
work it

i refer to your e  mail to jez last week and advise you the expected payment value and timing etc 
vessel name  mv  cotsworld 
eta    nov
ets    nov
loading tonnage  approx   kmt   kmt from stratford and  kmt from bengalla 
payment value and timing 
value timing
bengalla  us     mil     th    
stratford  us     mil     th
 inclusive of   gst
  bengall has already delivered  kmt of coal to port and will complete the delivery on  th 
the contract is based on fis and the invoice weight and quality be determined by the inbound analysis while they take des  dem risk 
because of their concern over our credit bengalla has insisted on our payment by tt against the presentation of documents  docs are likely to be
presented on  th or  th at the latest 
the draft contract which bengalla has confirmed has a provision that the invoice weight is determined based on b  l quantity instead of inbound rail weight
if we take   of bengalla coal onto our vessel  if we do that  they can not present their docs until the vessel has compeleted the loading and our payment date would be say  th instead 
regards
