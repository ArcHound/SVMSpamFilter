louise 
we are presently working with jody pierce to get the accounting system for the turbine book in place  and a turbine report form prepared  we will have this to you in the next  business days  the only recent news is the sale of the steam turbine for   k  and that we intend to utilize an outside consulting firm  navigant  to enhance our ability to get some interest going on the sw  d  a  lastly  we are reviewing the possibility of having the ft  pierce project use mhi unit   instead of unit   in light of the apparent market interest in units  and   and the current ft  pierce construction schedule which is better suited for unit   than unit   
mike coleman is putting together a budget and program to monitor  from a technical perspective  and maintain the  d  a and the  fs 
please let me know if you have any other questions 
regards 
ben

with the shipment of two of the four units from mhi scheduled for august and no viable place to ship them  our exposure to increasing costs associated with these units will start to climb quickly  we need to move agressively to minimize our risk in this position 
based on discussion with a number of people  i would strongly recommend that we make full efforts to sell units  and  as quickly as possible  john garrison has identified a number of potential buyers  and i believe that brett wiggs in in communication with one or more of them as we speak 
we should inform mhi that we will now target unit  for fort pierce  given the slowdown in the fort pierce schedule and the inability to get further reductions in pricing from mhi on unit   if we also drop the dual fuel requirement for fort pierce  we should provide some project savings to that project  prior to informing mhi  we shoud have jackson chaeng status the auxiliaries for unit  so we have a basis for understanding any appropriate cancellation costs 
i also recommend that we tentatively target unit  for tallahassee  unless sale of units  and  were contingent on delivering a  rd unit to a buyer  in the next three weeks we will review tallahassee versus best turbine fit and availability of alternative equipment to determine if we want to continue to target unit  to that project 
finally  mhi has requested that we allow an extention of ship date for unit  from august  to the end of august  i think it is in our best interests to agree to that directly  given that we can  t tell them where to ship it and would immediately face claims for storage costs if we insist on an august  ship date  we should ask that they forgo storage costs on auxiliaries until the later ship date 
probably everyone knows some of this  and some know all of this  but hopefully the overall picture is of value 
thanks
