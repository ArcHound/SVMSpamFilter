messrs  kopper and fastow had  extensive involvement in the organization  investment activity and operations  of jedi  according to the  ljm  private  offering memorandum  jedi invested     billion in  separate transactions  the document said  after accounting for jedi  s   million in equity  this indicates the partnership borrowed as much as     billion 
in   calpers sold its interest in jedi back to enron for about   million  at about the same time  calpers put   million into a new enron partnership  known as jedi ii 
at this point  enron could have held on to all of jedi  but that probably would have entailed consolidating the partnership and its debts into the company  s financial statements 
that  apparently  is where chewco came in   chewco got its name  says one person familiar with the matter  from the character chewbacca in the  star wars  movies  where jedi warriors also roamed   chewco bought from enron the jedi interest formerly held by calpers  according to documents and interviews  it couldn  t be determined what the terms of that transaction were  however  the fact that chewco shows up as a debtor to jedi in the texas state filing suggests that money for the purchase was borrowed from jedi itself 
the available information on the chain of transactions raises questions about how separate jedi and chewco really were from enron and whether jedi  s assets and liabilities should have been folded into the company  s financial statements 
in a march  sec filing  enron makes a brief reference to its new jedi partner  which enron doesn  t identify but presumably is chewco  the filing said  an officer of enron has invested in the limited partner of jedi and from time to time acts as agent on behalf of the limited partner  s management   while the officer isn  t named  the description is similar to that given for mr  kopper in relation to chewco in the ljm  offering memorandum 
in march of this year  enron moved to purchase the balance of jedi that it didn  t already own  in an sec filing earlier this year  enron said it acquired for   million  the limited partner  s interests  in jedi  again  the partner wasn  t named  but presumably was chewco 
enron consolidated jedi  s assets and liabilities into the company  the sec filing said jedi  s holdings included  million shares of enron stock  enron said it also paid off about   million of jedi  third  party debt   the third party or parties weren  t named

 copyright  c    dow jones it had no immediate comment friday 
enron shares were trading at about six times the company  s book value in late   by comparison  wall street brokerage firms typically trade at two or three times book value and hedge funds in effect are priced at book value 
among the pages of the  report that mr  chanos marked with yellow post  it notes and scribbled comments was one detailing the related  party transactions  he underlined a sentence stating that one of enron  s senior officers is the  managing member  of a private investment company with which enron had entered into a series of transactions   we read the disclosure over and over and over again  and we just didn  t understand it   and we read footnotes for a living   he says  but at the time  he concedes   it was just an odd footnote to us  
he started telephoning analysts at wall street firms to determine what aspects of the bulls  case he was missing  what he heard excited him further  part of the bullishness focused on enron  s strategy of trading broadband  network capacity  mr  chanos  who already had placed bearish bets on some telecommunications bandwidth providers  was convinced that the industry already suffered from overcapacity and that the situation would only get worse  his conclusion  if enron  couldn  t see the looming train wreck coming in telecom  what else were they missing  maybe they weren  t as infallible in the energy area as people had thought  
another warning signal was insider stock sales through the second half of   he says  that sat awkwardly with the common refrain from wall street analysts that investors had to just trust management given the difficulty of analyzing how earnings were derived  the company didn  t immediately comment on the sales on friday 
 you look for patterns in my business   says mr  chanos   the fact that this was a  trust me  story  while management was voting with its feet was another check  while we didn  t have a smoking gun  we certainly saw a reason to perhaps not trust management at its word that these earnings were what they said they were  
those factors led mr  chanos to begin shorting the stock in late november of last year  when it was fluctuating between   and    he won  t provide details  overall  the level of short interest  or short  selling positions not yet closed out  on enron shares jumped    million shares to    million shares for the month through mid december  from the same period in the previous month 
as other red flags surfaced  in february mr  chanos and other short sellers significantly ramped up the bearish positions  mr  chanos first discussed his view of enron with those outside the firm that month in miami  where he hosted his annual  bears in hibernation  conference  attendees bring two ideas to present  and one of his was enron 
with enron  s stock trading at   at that time  or roughly  times   s per  share earnings estimates   the market is priced for perfection here   mr  chanos told the  or so attendees   whereas it looks like things may be anything but  
back in new york  mr  chanos arranged a second round of sessions with bullish analysts   here  s our thesis   he told them   what are we missing  
mr  chanos came out of those meetings with a  heightened conviction that we were right   for one thing  he sensed frustration brewing about the level of trust required with enron 
as the spring progressed  mr  chanos became increasingly confident  adding to his short position  on a widely reported conference call in april  jeffrey skilling  then enron  s chief executive  responded to another short seller  s criticism that enron hadn  t provided a balance sheet by calling him an  ah   for the first time   i got a sense that the company was now getting tough questions and was not happy about it   mr  chanos says 
for their part  wall street analysts argue that they have limited time and resources for the in  depth research that mr  chanos prefers  many cover dozens of companies  still  some say they have learned lessons from enron  s fall from grace  salomon smith barney analyst raymond niles  for one  says he will  pursue warning signs relentlessly and go by gut instinct  when he senses a looming problem  says mr  niles  who covers enron   i think shorts play a very valuable role in the market  reminding us of what can go wrong

what enron  s financial reports did   and didn  t   reveal    auditor could face scrutiny on clarity of financial reports

as enron corp   s independent auditor  arthur andersen llp has the job of making sure the houston energy trader  s financial statements not only are accurate and complete in all material respects  but also are understandable 
now for the really tricky part  understandable to whom 
for andersen  this isn  t just an academic question  once again  the accounting practices of one of the big five firm  s most prized clients have come under intense scrutiny from regulators and shareholders  questions could well turn to whether andersen fulfilled its obligation to protect investors  interests  and an important focus is likely to be whether andersen should have required enron to better explain its dealings with partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew s  fastow before agreeing to bless the company  s financial statements 
enron revealed last month  in a conference call  that its shareholder equity had fallen by     billion during the third quarter as a result of transactions in which a partnership controlled by mr  fastow was at least at times involved  fueling a steep dive in the stock price amid growing concerns about the company  s financial health  many wall street analysts  including die  hard enron bulls  long have grumbled that parts of enron  s financial statements are indecipherable 
 the heart of disclosure is intelligibility   says alan bromberg  a professor of securities law at southern methodist university in dallas   if the people to whom it  s addressed can  t understand it  it hasn  t been adequately disclosed  there  s clearly a qualitative  as well as a factual  component to disclosure  
under generally accepted accounting principles  the rules for disclosing related  party transactions seem straightforward enough  among other things  companies must describe the  information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements   but the nation  s accounting  standard setters never have offered any clear guidance on whether companies  disclosures should be understandable to a broad audience or merely to financially sophisticated individuals with specialized training  and even sophisticated investors are prone to being stumped now and then 
to be sure  the adequacy of a company  s related  party disclosures can be determined only when all the information about the transactions is out in the open  for its part  enron   which is hardly the only large energy company with complex partnership dealings   maintains its off  balance  sheet transactions were legal and properly disclosed   they comply with reporting requirements   says enron spokeswoman karen denne  adding that andersen was aware of the transactions and reviewed them   to the extent that an investor doesn  t understand them  they are able to ask questions   and in the end  she notes  investors who didn  t understand the transactions didn  t have to buy enron stock 
enron  s disclosure practices stand out  however  because they have been a source of complaints for so long  even some top  flight accounting professors say they can  t make heads or tails of the company  s transactions with mr  fastow or enron  s motives for entering them  if they can  t figure them out  it raises the question of whether any outsider could 
one thing is certain  the stakes for andersen could be high  since enron  s disclosure of the reduction in shareholder equity  its stock has plunged   to     as of  p  m  in new york stock exchange composite trading friday   a drop that wipes   billion off the company  s market value and potentially exposing enron and andersen to massive shareholder liability  already  enron  s dealings with the partnerships are the subject of a formal investigation by the securities and exchange commission  that creates the possibility that andersen itself could become a focus of the probe at some point  should regulators find enron  s accounting and disclosure practices deficient  meanwhile  the law firm for a special committee set up by enron  s board has hired accounting firm deloitte  touche llp to help review the partnerships  activities 
an andersen spokesman  david tabolt  says the firm  will continue to cooperate with  enron  s  special committee  lawyers and accounting advisers  and  will also cooperate with other official investigations as requested   so far  he says  the sec hasn  t told andersen it is a subject of the enron probe  beyond that  he declines to comment on enron  citing client  confidentiality obligations 
how murky are the related  party disclosures in enron  s audited financial statements  here is a summary of a section in enron  s  year  end financial statements describing certain transactions with the fastow  operated partnerships  the company said it transferred assets valued at     billion  including   million in notes payable     million restricted enron shares and the right to receive as many as  million enron common shares in march   subject to certain conditions  it also transferred to the partnerships other assets valued at   million  including a   million note payable and  an investment in an entity that indirectly holds warrants convertible into common stock of an enron equity method investee  
in return  enron said it received  economic interests in the entities     million in notes receivable and an additional     billion in notes receivable as part of a  special distribution   the disclosure went on to mention a series of purchases by enron of  share  settled options from the entities  on shares of enron common stock 
the raw numbers may all be there  but  any objective person would be hard pressed to understand the effects of these disclosures on the financial statements   says douglas carmichael  an accounting professor at baruch college in new york   the quality of the disclosure is low  which creates uncertainty about the quality of their accounting  
further  he says  enron  s explanation of why it entered the transactions  seems to defy imagination   in the year  end financial statement  enron said the purpose was  to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets   a category that includes energy assets whose values are prone to wide price fluctuations  yet the disclosure shows that enron chose to use shares and options of its own stock as its chief hedging instrument  even though their price movements wouldn  t appear to be directly related to the value of the investments enron was trying to hedge 
 i don  t see how that possibly hedges any of enron  s risks or assets   mr  carmichael says  indeed  the disclosures have given rise to widespread speculation that enron  s actual purpose was to use its off  balance  sheet transactions to shift losses off its books to avoid running them through its income statement  asked whether that was enron  s purpose  ms  denne declines to comment  she says enron stands by its earlier statement that enron was trying to hedge certain investments 
to date  andersen hasn  t been named as a defendant in any of the numerous shareholder lawsuits filed against enron  which paid andersen   million last year  including   million in audit fees  enron  s woes come during a year already filled with embarrassments for andersen  in june  the sec fined andersen and three partners   million over their audits of waste management inc   s financial statements  the largest sec fine ever against an accounting firm  andersen  which neither admitted nor denied the sec  s fraud allegations  paid   million in  to settle its portion of a shareholder lawsuit over the houston  based garbage hauler  also this year  without admitting wrongdoing  andersen agreed to pay   million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for sunbeam corp

the journalists on this enron  ene  nyse  news  commentary  story seem oblivious to the big issue here  why did enron need to do the partnerships in the first place 
that  to me  is the issue   because the only reason you would set up all of these  perfectly legal  partnerships  as they keep calling them down there  is to hide something 
what would they be trying to hide  let  s step aside for a second and ask a few hypotheticals 
if you had information about how a market was doing  you might want to do something with that information that you didn  t want anyone to know about  for example  let  s say you had access to all of the trading information about where electricity was going   you had access to the grid   you might be able to take advantage of that information with an off  book partnership  you would need that off  book partnership because you wouldn  t want any of those people from whom you took the data thinking that you were taking advantage of those data 
or if you knew that a market was about to be squeezed upward and you wanted to facilitate that squeeze  you could buy electricity and keep it from  say  california  until rates went up  and then dump it in california once the squeeze was complete 
or you might just want to make a few bucks on the side that you didn  t want to share with shareholders and you needed to have something special  something hidden from shareholders  to make those few bucks 
or the parent company didn  t know anything about these partnerships  and the people running them were just living large without much oversight 
or the parent company was worried about its credit rating  so it wanted to hide debt 
i don  t know  can someone come up with better reasons you would do this  i can  t  can someone come up with something that  s not nefarious 
please email me 
i want to know why anyone would do this  a good reason that we would all appreciate as shareholders

the afl  cio  a federation of us trade unions  is calling for sweeping governance reform measures at enron  the embattled energy trader  to restore investor confidence amid a probe by federal regulators into its finances 
 america  s working families are significant shareholders of enron stock through their pension  health and welfare benefit funds   said the afl  cio  which is the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations 
the union  sponsored funds under the afl  cio  which represents  m americans  hold    m enron shares  the amalgamated bank  the trustee of long view funds  which holds    enron shares  has also joined in the call for corporate reform  those funds are investment trusts managing equity assets on behalf of workers  pension funds 
the two were the first big shareholders to make demands on enron since the crisis of confidence in the company began on october  with the surprise disclosure of a     bn balance sheet adjustment 
they said the mandate of the special committee  created by enron  s board to examine the transactions in question and liaise with the securities and exchange commission during its investigation  was too narrow 
they want the committee to examine all transactions with entities in which enron employees or directors have an interest  adopt procedures for reviewing insider participation in investments  start an extraordinary review of executive compensation  adopt a stricter definition of director independence and  finally  disclose director conflicts of interest

the document said kopper  besides being a  principal  of ljm    manages the general partner of chewco  an investment fund with approximately   million in capital commitments that was established in  to purchase from enron an interest in a defined pool of enron assets

 c  reuters limited  
bombay  nov   reuters   lenders to an indian power plant that is majority  owned by troubled enron corp will meet in singapore with the u  s  energy giant to discuss the     billion project  a banking source said on monday 
houston  based enron is seeking to head off a credit crunch and restore investor confidence  damaged after its credit rating was cut and u  s  authorities began investigating its financial transactions 
the meeting in singapore this weekend will examine offers that two indian companies have put forward to buy enron  s  percent stake in dabhol power company  dpc   which is building the controversial project  the banking source told reuters 
 the meeting will gauge the interest of the two bidders   the source said 
enron has been in talks with tata power  india  s largest private electricity firm  and bses ltd about selling the stake  a deal in the works well before the recent crisis of confidence 
bses and tata power officials were not immediately available for comment 
enron  s assets in dabhol are estimated to be worth   million  analysts said 
who blinks first
 it is a matter of who blinks first   said one banker familiar with the negotiations   but given enron  s recent troubles  we expect them to sell at a substantial discount  
sources at the lending banks told reuters enron was willing to sell its holding in dabhol power at a  to  percent discount 
an enron spokesman said he was unable to comment 
but in august  houston  based enron said it and its foreign partners were ready to sell their stakes in dabhol for no less than     billion  an amount said to be sufficient to cover their costs and direct financial investment in the project 
enron  s deteriorating position  including a drop of almost  percent it is share price in less than a month  has close watchers of the company saying it will probably have to break itself up if it is to stay independent 
analysts say that while enron had lined up   billion in credit last thursday  it may have to sell power plants  pipelines and some of its energy trading assets  the company could also be the object of a takeover bid 
bitter dispute
the first phase of the controversial    mw dabhol power plant  india  s largest foreign direct investment  has been completed  but work on the second phase was abruptly stopped in june following a bitter dispute between enron and the plant  s sole buyer  a loss  making indian utility 
the meeting in singapore will take place a few days before the expiry of enron  s six  month notice to the utility expressing its intention to terminate the power purchase agreement 
this contract governs the terms of the sale of power by dabhol to the state  run maharashtra state electricity board  mseb   the nearly bankrupt power distribution monoply in the state where the plant is located 
after november   enron will be entitled  under the terms of the contract  to submit the dispute to binding arbitration by the international court of arbitration in london 
u  s  conglomerate general electric and construction firm bechtel corp each own  percent in the project  with the remaining  percent held by mseb
