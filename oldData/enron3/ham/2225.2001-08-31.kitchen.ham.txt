Subject abb
enron canada may be close to selling the abb units for over   mm  please refrain from offering a lower price to brokers  consultants  etc  on these units for a week  we should still mention them as available and should still work on putting them on eol  if this party is real  it might be slick to have them close the transaction electronically
