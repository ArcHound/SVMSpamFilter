subject  power  edison mission energy lines up   mln loan to
refinance debt
         new york 
rosemead  california  july   bloomberg    edison mission
energy  a subsidiary of edison international  is lining up a  
million loan to help refinance     billion of maturing bank
debt  according to people close to the company 
credit suisse first boston is leading the transaction  which
will be held by a small number of banks  those familiar with the
loan said 
the generating company is a separate legal entity from edison
and its insolvent utility subsidiary  southern california edison 
a holding company that owns all of edison mission  s stock was set
up earlier this year to protect the company  s assets in case the
utility ends up in bankruptcy 
  it would be harder to get any financing done at any of the
edison subsidiaries after a bankruptcy filing   by southern
california edison  said jon kyle cartwright  a senior energy
credit analyst at raymond james  associates  inc  in st 
petersburg  florida 
edison mission borrowed from its three bank lines and has to
repay bank debt of   million by mid  august  the new loan will
replace the   billion of bank credit lines that the company has
to repay by oct    the people said 
  getting this financing done is probably one of the reasons
that socaled hasn  t filed   for bankruptcy protection  cartwright
said 
negotiating a solution
southern california edison ran up more than     billion in
debts to pay for soaring wholesale power costs last year  the
state  s power deregulation laws prohibited the company from
passing on those costs in the form of higher consumer rates 
in an effort to conserve cash  the utility defaulted on more
than   million of notes and commercial paper in january  the
utility also owes energy providers more than   billion  any three
unsecured creditors can file a petition to put the utility into
involuntary bankruptcy 
ted craver  chief financial officer at edison  said that the
company believes that bankruptcy isn  t an answer to the
  political  regulatory problem   that put the utility into this
position    we continue to seek a negotiated solution to restore  
the utility  s creditworthiness  craver said on a conference call
with investors holding the defaulted debt 
while southern california edison is junk  rated  edison
mission energy has the lowest investment grade credit ratings  
  bbb    from standard  poor  s and   baa    from moody  s
investors service 
investment grade
edison mission sold   million of   year notes in april 
which are trading between  and  cents on the dollar  up from
between    and  cents on the dollar at the end of june 
moody  s based the company  s investment grade ratings on the
fact that it has enough cash flow to cover its debts and that its
assets ought to be protected in case southern california edison
either files for bankruptcy protection or is pushed into it 
the new loans are split between   day and three  year
maturities  bankers familiar with the deal said 
  these are lottery tickets  not investments    said
cartwright  those who buy them are   investing on optimism  not on
arithmetic  and that isn  t a good investment strategy   
the bankruptcy remote structure  which pg  e corp   the parent
of bankrupt pacific gas  electric co   also put in place to
protect its generating subsidiary  s assets  hasn  t been tested in
court yet  analysts said 
  liz goldenberg in the new york newsroom at       or at
egoldenberg   bloomberg  net and mark lake at       or at
mlakel  bloomberg  net with reporting by terrence flanagan  jm
