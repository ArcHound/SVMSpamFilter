Subject follow  up to this mornings meeting
louise 
apologies  but i forgot to mention a couple items on florida on this morning  s call 
with respect to our florida development book  and the midway site in particular  we have  value propositions that we  re working on  we talked about the first one  which relates to the sale of the development asset  with a target gross sales price of   million   the others are as follows 
  leverage site positions to bid into fpl  s recently announced    mw rfp 
  leverage site positions to negotiate third party long term tolling contracts for unit contingent power 
  leverage site positions to build a merchant power plant 
on item   we have been speaking with fpl for some time  and we think we may have a competitive advantage  because of the number and maturity of our development assets  to offer a unit contingent contract to fpl  or simply a sale of one or more sites  if we were awarded a contract  we could go in the market  buy turbines  and flip the package  a la lv cogen   heather kroll and i are working on this together 
on item   i was contacted by williams a couple of weeks ago  they indicated they were interested in a  to  year tolling contract off our midway site  we have since signed a confidentiality agreement  and are discussing indicative terms  as with item   if we negotiated a deal with williams  we could go in the market  buy turbines  and flip the package  aquila is also a prospect for this type of deal  as they are seeking long term tolling positions in the state  i have brought heather into this deal as well 
on item   last week kevin indicated he has renewed interest in florida  duran and i will try to figure out this week exactly what this means 
please let me know if you have any questions 
see you tomorrow
