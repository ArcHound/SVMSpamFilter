enron corp  warned that continuing credit worries  a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth  quarter earnings 
the energy company said it may be forced to take a   million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships  the partnership  whitewing llp  held assets with a book value of     billion on nov   but a drop in the value of enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of   million  the company said 
in addition  enron  houston  said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a   million note  that note became a  demand obligation   on nov    when enron  s credit rating got lowered to triple  b  minus by standard  poor  s  the company didn  t disclose who holds the note 
 we  ve got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets   said company spokesman mark palmer  one of the assets includes c  e  g  rio  a gas distribution company in brazil that enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction  the company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash 
enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and  in some cases  to keep debt off its balance sheet  in the wake of a securities and exchange commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched oct    the company restated its earnings downward dating back to  and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet 
the company on nov   agreed to merge with competitor dynegy inc  but its latest sec filing said it was sued by shareholders on nov   in state court in houston to prevent the merger from happening  the petition alleges that enron  s directors breached their fiduciary duties to enron  s shareholders by agreeing to sell enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to enron  enron said it would vigorously defend itself 
yesterday  s filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses  in its original third  quarter statement  the company reported a loss of   million  the stated loss was increased to   million last week and in the latest filing  the loss for the quarter ended sept   was widened to   million 
enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren  t necessarily final because its external auditor  arthur andersen  hasn  t completed its review  nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm  s accounting practices

senior wall street bankers are concerned that dynegy could walk away from its proposed     bn      bn  rescue bid for its rival energy group enron  a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets 
in a series of interviews with the financial times  bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for dynegy to pull out  some of the company  s shareholders were under the impression that the  material adverse change  clause could be triggered 
 there is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen  or even likely to happen   one banker said   and the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good   he added  none of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified 
the possibility of dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from jp morgan chase and citigroup  which are advising enron  met with officials from moody  s  the credit rating agencies   days ago 
the rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for dynegy to give up its bid  further undermining enron  s creditworthiness 
moody  s decision to preserve enron  s investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid 
in justifying the all  stock bid  chuck watson  chairman of dynegy  said last week that buying the company for a low price  a fraction of enron  s market capitalisation at its peak in   was a major protection against failure 
but he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with moody  s had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose 
according to dynegy  the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a securities and exchange commission inquiry into enron  s finances  possible litigation against the energy company  balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts  www  ft  com  enron

enron drops earnings for  rd quarter
  million debt comes due for downgraded firm
by tom fowler
copyright  houston chronicle
enron corp   s financial well  being continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings monday 
in a securities and exchange commission filing  enron said it reduced third  quarter earnings by  cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of  by  cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors 
the company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a   million note by nov   if it doesn  t find collateral to guarantee the debt 
the revelations came in the embattled energy trader  s   q document  which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet  enron delayed releasing the   q by five days and said the filing made monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm  andersen  because of an ongoing investigation by the company  s board of directors and the need for more time 
 we are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation   said william k  powers jr   chairman of enron  s special investigation committee and dean of the university of texas school of law 
enron  s pending   million iou is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in brazil  one of the terms of the partnership requires enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to bbb  on rating agency standard  poor  s scale  which it did nov    if enron doesn  t put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it  the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership  s assets 
enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt 
if enron  s debt rating continues to drop  which would put it below investment grade  the company would face another     billion in debt repayments  the company said in the filing  mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years      billion owed by osprey trust and   million by marlin water trust 
enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies  but a cash infusion from dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible   million to   billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat 
the turmoil around enron  s finances started after oct    when steep losses in its third  quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the company  s board of directors 
the ljm partnerships were formed using enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company  s new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company  s stock 
the cfo  s dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an sec investigation as well as an internal enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past     years by nearly   million 
those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in enron  which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating  the company eventually reached a deal with rival dynegy to be acquired for almost   billion in stock plus the assumption of almost   billion in debt and   billion in preferred stock 
the fallout from enron  s crumble is spreading to its major service providers  including andersen  that firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit  while on monday rep  john dingell  d  mich   called for an investigation of andersen in connection with its audits of enron and houston  based waste management 
 the best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting   dingell wrote in a letter to the public oversight board requesting the investigation 
andersen  based in chicago  has a large houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients  including enron and dynegy  critics of andersen have said the firm should have done more as enron  s auditor to draw investors  attention to the company  s unusual finances 
a lawsuit filed in oregon alleged andersen  s judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from enron while it was auditor 
in june  andersen was fined   million by the sec to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management  the largest civil penalty against a big five accounting firm  andersen did not admit or deny the charges

enron corp  warned in a regulatory filing that it could be forced to pay a    million debt by next week and reduced its already abysmal third  quarter earnings 
the energy giant said a downgrading of its debt last week triggered a monday deadline for it to repay or offer collateral against the   million owed to a party in one of its partnerships 
if the debt isn  t paid  the partner could liquidate the partnership  s assets  which include a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise   million in cash 
enron has already used up its    billion credit line  secured roughly   billion in loans and is looking for more cash 
the company reduced its previously reported results for the third quarter by  cents a share  according to its filing with the securities and exchange commission  that would put its loss at  cents a share

washington   concerned about the accounting profession  s ability to police itself  a senior house of representatives democrat has called for a  special investigation  of arthur andersen llp and its audits of enron corp  and waste management inc 
in a letter to u  s  public oversight board chairman charles bowsher released monday  rep  john dingell  a michigan democrat  requested a review of andersen  s audits of enron and waste management  two high  profile audit failures 
enron  of houston  which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival dynergy inc   acknowledged it overstated net income by   million     million euros  and will need to restate financial reports dating back to  
the u  s  securities and exchange commission is investigating enron  s treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former chief financial officer andrew fastow 
enron  s problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for andersen  in june  the firm reached a   million settlement with the sec in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of waste management 
andersen and the waste hauler paid   million in  to settle class  action lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated waste management  s reported earnings in the mid   s 
in addition to the sec  s probe of its role in the enron matter  andersen is undergoing routine peer review by deloitte  touche  dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that deloitte  touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of enron  s board of directors 
given the potential conflict of interest on the part of deloitte  touche  and andersen  s track record   there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in andersen or the peer review process   mr  dingell wrote

some senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages 
last week  enron corp  chairman kenneth lay decided to forgo a     million severance payment that would have been triggered by dynegy inc   s planned acquisition of the houston energy trader  enron initially said mr  lay would keep one  third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined company  he later decided against any severance payment after criticism by influential energy traders  who produce most of enron  s profits 
 in this environment  we  re seeing producers putting pressure on managers and managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line with their performance   says ira kay  executive  compensation practice leader of pay  and  benefits consultants watson wyatt worldwide in new york 
alan johnson  managing director of new york pay consultants johnson associates  says mr  lay  s initial intention to accept a portion of his severance represents  the continuing trend of executives being clueless  
 for the  months ended aug    mr  lay received about   million from exercising enron stock options  according to disclosure reports tracked by thomson financial  
three top executives of us airways group inc   including chief executive rakesh gangwal and chairman stephen wolf  passed up severance after deciding to stay at the company when a planned merger fell through  the trio stood to gain   million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered by shareholder approval of its now  defunct merger accord with ual corp  at us airways  sept   annual meeting  they said they would remain with the company

in new filing  enron reports debt squeeze
by richard a  oppel jr  and floyd norris

c   new york times company
the enron corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash  it said that if any of a number of things went wrong  its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question 
in a delayed quarterly filing with the securities and exchange commission  the company said that it would have to repay   million in debt by next tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan 
enron has about     billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of     billion by the end of next year  the report for the third quarter  which was filed five days late  says the company faces immediate demand for     billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further 
enron  s independent auditors with the firm of arthur andersen have not been able to complete their review of enron  s financial statements for the third quarter  andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of enron  s books related to enron  s disclosure this month that it had overstated almost   million in profits in the last five years  enron has said that it will restate statements that andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon 
yesterday  representative john d  dingell of michigan  the ranking democrat on the house energy and commerce committee  called for an investigation into arthur andersen  s handling of the enron audits  a spokesman for andersen could not be reached last night 
enron  the nation  s largest energy trader  has agreed to be acquired by dynegy inc   its smaller crosstown rival in houston  and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of enron  which is now at the lowest investment  grade rating  any downgrades could lead to a collapse of enron  s core energy trading business  analysts say  as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with enron entirely 
the dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year  and the disclosures yesterday indicate that enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then  particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed  enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next september 
enron is in talks to obtain   million to   billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions  in addition  executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell   million in assets by the end of the year  and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year  enron is also set to receive a   billion infusion from chevrontexaco  which owns a  percent stake in dynegy  if the deal closes next year 
still  even after factoring in cash flow from enron  s core energy  trading operations  enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year   meaning that enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities 
carol coale  an analyst for prudential securities in houston  said the new disclosures indicated that enron  s troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed  even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with dynegy was announced 
  our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank    ms  coale said    but now it sounds like enron  s problems were actually more inherent than perceived   
enron  s deal with dynegy calls for enron holders to receive    dynegy share for each enron share  but in trading since the deal was announced enron  s share price has lagged dynegy  s price  reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms 
in new york stock exchange trading yesterday  before the enron filing was released  enron rose  cents  to      and dynegy rose      to      at those prices  the value of the dynegy offer is    percent above enron  s share price  compared with a    percent difference when the deal was announced 
some debts that enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares  but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further  and the merger agreement with dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger   currently     an enron share 
in after  hours trading yesterday  after the release of the enron filing  the share price slipped to   
enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than   million  yesterday  s filing provided some additional details on enron  s relationships with various related partnerships whose debts enron could be forced to pay  and it said that additional write  offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined  it said that because enron  s stock value had fallen  one write  down could be   million 
the disclosures show that enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet 
but the collapse of enron  s stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts 
  it is not possible to predict    enron warned investors  whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful    an adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on enron  s ability to continue as a going concern

decision to locate conocophillips in houston enhances world  s energy capital

houston  ap   the decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of phillips petroleum co  and conoco inc  in houston  home of the smaller conoco  helps cement the city  s status as the nation  s energy capital 
 houston already was the energy capital of the world  this just proves it   said mark baxter  director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university in dallas 
 all the major players are in houston and houston can accommodate the employee growth base   he said   it is easier to conduct the business in the houston market because not only are all the major companies there  all the support is in houston as well  
the dlrs    billion deal announced sunday that would create the nation  s third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for houston  even though the nation  s two largest oil companies  irving  based exxonmobil and san francisco  based chevrontexaco  have their headquarters located elsewhere  each has thousands of employees working in the nation  s fourth  largest city 
it all began with the  spindletop strike in southeast texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental united states  vast oil resources lay beneath texas soil 
 historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries   said david bole  the vice president of randall  dewey  inc   a houston  based oil consulting firm   but certainly with high  speed communications developed over the last  years  the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers 
 what has set houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters  their vision and their ability to build mega  companies  in many cases it is their legacy that has built houston into today  s oil capital  
shell oil co  is based in houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling  oil field services  pipeline  oil field firefighting and related companies 
in recent years  the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as dynegy  inc   enron corp   reliant inc  and others  together  they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city 
 consolidation is cumulative  a self  fulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place   bill gilmer  an economist in houston for the federal reserve bank of dallas  wrote in a recent publication   the same principles  of course  are what draw moviemakers to hollywood  financial service providers to new york and automakers to detroit  
and  it seems  energy companies to houston

companies  finance the americas  energy deal savings set to increase

chevrontexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to     bn by march  
david o  reilly  chief executive  told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of     bn within six to nine months of the deal  which was completed last month 
mr o  reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of    to  per cent over the next five years  and dismissed worries about the falling oil price 
 our business is used to swings and volatility  if you want a stable price environment you don  t want to be in this business   he told reporters after addressing analysts in new york 
mr o  reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry  the   bn deal between conoco and phillips petroleum  only made him more confident that the chevrontexaco deal was right 
chevrontexaco now claims to be the third  largest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourth  largest in global oil and natural gas production  he said the synergies translated into gains of about   per share after tax 
chevrontexaco has an important role in dynegy  s rescue bid for enron  the rival energy group  chevrontexaco has a  per cent stake in dynegy and immediately invested     bn in convertible preferred shares of dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in enron  chevrontexaco is committed to buying a further   bn of dynegy common stock once dynegy completes its takeover  if the deal fails  chevrontexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for     bn in cash or convert to common shares  giving it a  per cent stake in equity 
mr o  reilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal  despite worries about potential hidden liabilities at enron 
chevrontexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at enron  and mr o  reilly said there was  a full suite of due diligence  that needed to be done on other issues at enron 
 enron  s lenders welcomed the energy company  s openness yesterday following a meeting in new york  greg whalley  enron  s president  led the meeting  which was postponed when dynegy began talks with enron two weeks ago 
 much of senior management was there and they were doing a good job   said one  another banker said enron management had been  pretty upfront  about the problems at the company  although he said most lenders were reluctant to air their concerns in full at the crowded meeting

usa  enron sounds debt alarm  reduces reported earnings 
by c  bryson hull

 c  reuters limited  
houston  nov   reuters   humbled energy giant enron corp  on monday warned that it could be forced to pay a   million debt by next week and reduced its already  abysmal third  quarter earnings 
the houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on monday with u  s  securities and exchange commission 
among the new information included is the disclosure that enron is up against a short deadline to meet a   million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week  that marked the start of a nine  day period that expires on nov    during which enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships 
if not  the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership  which includes a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise   million in cash 
the company is working to make alternative payment arrangements  since it can ill  afford to pay the debt now  enron has already already maxed out its   billion credit line  secured roughly   billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat 
enron also reduced previously reported  third  quarter earnings by  cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first  months of the year by a penny per share  the move reflects adjustments made after the quarter  s end  enron said 
on oct    enron reported a loss of   million or  cents per share for the third quarter of   on nov   enron said it had restated earnings for    and that net income for the four  year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported 
it also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay     billion to other partnerships  the bulk of it to osprey trust and marlin water trust 
such an outcome would keep enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and  would likely have a material adverse impact on enron  s ability to continue as a going concern   the company wrote 
enron had released those figures earlier  but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability 
credit could be a killer
moody  s investors service and standard  poor  s this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for enron to  baa   and  bbb  minus   just one notch above  junk  status  each warned it may cut its respective ratings again  moody  s also cut enron  s short  term debt rating  which affects commercial paper  to  not prime   a junk rating 
in nearly all of its partnership deals  enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels  at the close of trading monday on the new york stock exchange  enron shares were at      well below the trigger prices 
all of the partnerships  which enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet  have become the once  proud company  s bane  the sec is investigating potential conflict  of  interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow served as general partner 
enron had to extract itself from those partnerships  which led to a     billion reduction in enron shareholder equity 
the revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory  leaving enron to be bought on nov   by smaller cross  town rival dynegy inc  for the fire  sale price of   billion in stock 
in an unusual note  enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant  per sec regulations  because of  the need of arthur andersen llp  enron  s independent auditors  to complete their review procedures  
arthur andersen had no comment  but enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by enron  s board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit  s completion

enron corp  warned that continuing credit worries  a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth  quarter earnings  tuesday  s wall street journal reported 
the energy company said it may be forced to take a   million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships  the partnership  whitewing llp  held assets with a book value of     billion on nov   but a drop in the value of enron  ene  stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of   million  the company said 
in addition  enron  houston  said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a   million note  that note became a  demand obligation   on nov    when enron  s credit rating got lowered to triple  b  minus by standard  poor  s  the company didn  t disclose who holds the note 
 we  ve got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets   said company spokesman mark palmer  one of the assets includes c  e  g  rio  a gas distribution company in brazil that enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction  the company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash 
enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and  in some cases  to keep debt off its balance sheet  in the wake of a securities and exchange commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched oct    the company restated its earnings downward dating back to  and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet 
the company on nov   agreed to merge with competitor dynegy inc   dyn   but its latest sec filing said it was sued by shareholders on nov   in state court in houston to prevent the merger from happening  the petition alleges that enron  s directors breached their fiduciary duties to enron  s shareholders by agreeing to sell enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to enron  enron said it would vigorously defend itself 
monday  s filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses  in its original third  quarter statement  the company reported a loss of   million  the stated loss was increased to   million last week and in the latest filing  the loss for the quarter ended sept   was widened to   million 
enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren  t necessarily final because its external auditor  arthur andersen  hasn  t completed its review  nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm  s accounting practices

week  
houston  nov    bloomberg    enron corp   which agreed to
a takeover by dynegy inc  after a financial crisis threatened it
with bankruptcy  revised third  quarter earnings for the second
time this month and said it may have to make early payment of a
  million note next week 
the houston  based company lowered results by  cents a share 
bringing its third  quarter loss to  cents  or   million 
according to a securities  exchange commission filing 
liabilities from an affiliated partnership may reduce fourth 
quarter earnings by   million before taxes  enron said 
the disclosures don  t indicate that enron is in much worse
shape than on nov    said john olson  an energy analyst at
sanders morris harris  that  s when enron lowered its earnings back
to  by   million  reflecting losses by affiliated
partnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books 
  i don  t think anyone would be particularly surprised that
they had to adjust third  quarter earnings  again  considering they
restated earnings for the last four years    said olson  who
doesn  t own shares of dynegy or enron    i don  t think it  s a
problem   
making good on debt owed by its whitewing partnership may cut
enron  s fourth  quarter earnings  enron is obligated to back
whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock  because
enron  s stock has plunged  it may have to write down its assets by

partnership problems
enron said that the dynegy buyout could collapse if enron is
forced to pay judgments of more than   billion to settle lawsuits
over its dealings with affiliated partnerships  dynegy has said it
can cancel the transaction if enron  s litigation costs and other
liabilities grow to     billion or more  enron faces at least 
such lawsuits 
enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and
take debt off its books  its shares plunged by  percent this
year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were
being used to hide losses from failed investments 
chief executive officer kenneth lay said earlier this month
that buying back  million shares from two such partnerships cost
enron shareholders     billion in lost equity  the company wrote
off     billion in investments in water  telecommunications and
retail  energy sales in the third quarter 
a drop in enron  s senior unsecured debt rating to   bbb    by
standard  poor  s on nov   may force enron to pay off the  
million note by nov   if it doesn  t find collateral to guarantee
the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership  the company
said 
brazilian liability
without repayment or collateral  investors in a partnership
that owns brazilian natural  gas assets can begin to liquidate the
partnership  s assets  enron said  enron said it  s working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt 
  if we can  t talk lenders into refinancing  there is the
possibility that    note would be due next week    said karen
denne  an enron spokeswoman 
as of friday  the company had     billion in cash on hand 
it expects to close on   million in additional financing
tomorrow  and to complete   million in asset sales by the end
of the year  it  s also trying to find investors who will put  
million to   billion into the company 
the company has raised cash in recent weeks by using its
pipelines as collateral  it received     billion from
chevrontexaco last week as part of the dynegy buyout agreement  in
return  dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in an
enron unit that owns the northern natural gas pipeline  dynegy can
acquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through 
enron closed on a   million loan from j  p  morgan chase 
co  and salomon smith barney inc  on wednesday that was secured
with assets of enron  s transwestern pipeline co  it expects to
close on another   million loan  secured with other northern
natural gas assets  this week  denne said  the commitment for the
loans was announced nov   
    billion liability
the company also has huge liabilities that could push it into
financial crisis before the merger closes  a further drop in its
debt rating  which would put it below investment grade  would
trigger repayment of     billion in debt owed by two other
affiliated companies  enron said 
the rating drop would force it to repay     billion in debt
owed by osprey trust  and   million in debt taken on by marlin
water trust  the company said in the filing 
arthur andersen llp  enron  s auditor  didn  t grant final
approval of its financial statements in the filing because of an
internal investigation of its dealings with affiliated
partnerships  enron said  the sec is also investigating the
partnerships  which were run by enron executives 
the filing was released after the stock market closed  shares

dynegy inc   said david o  reilly  chief executive officer of
chevrontexaco inc   which is helping to back dynegy  s purchase 
chevrontexaco is   paying particular attention to the
litigation risk    though   we still think it  s a good deal for
dynegy and an even better deal for chevrontexaco    reilly said at
an analyst meeting in new york 
chevrontexaco  the second  biggest u  s  oil company  owns 
percent of dynegy  it agreed to provide dynegy     billion as
part of the enron purchase  dynegy can cancel the bid if enron  s
legal liabilities  including investor suits  exceed     billion 
enron said today in a regulatory filing it can  t calculate the
cost of shareholder suits 
dynegy agreed  days ago to buy rival enron  the largest
energy trader  for stock and debt now valued at     billion 
enron  s stock had plunged in recent weeks because of concerns it
was using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt 
gold bennett cera  sidner llp filed a class action suit in
houston today alleging enron misrepresented its business and
results  other investors have filed similar suits 
chevrontexaco will have a clearer picture of the legal risks
in the next few months  o  reilly said    there is no transaction
that is risk free    he said
