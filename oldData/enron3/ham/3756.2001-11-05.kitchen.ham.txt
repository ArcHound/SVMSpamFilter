subject  update  meeting w  edison re  recovery of negative ctc claim
 we met with edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative ctc claim 
 edison continues to take a very hard  line  extreme position  this is it in a nutshell 
  all customers   bundled and da alike    contributed to edison  s undercollection  and all customers must pay it down 
  bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and da customers contributed through the negative ctc 
  edison says it will pay esps past due amounts related to the negative ctc  but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills   da and bundled alike   to recover its undercollection 
  edison intends to collect it over approximately  years  edison estimates that the charge to da customers over this period would be about      mwh 
  under edison  s plan  enron would likely end up paying edison  i  e   the present value of the  undercollection  charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative ctc payment 
 obviously  with respect to any settlement with edison  we  re extremely far apart and we  re therefore considering other options 
 in the meantime  the california puc is engaged in da and px credit  related activities beginning next week and edison will try to get the commission to adopt their proposal 
 we are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose edison  s proposal at the puc 
 we will distribute something on monday describing our approach and tactics at the puc for folks to review and comment on 
 we are scheduled to meet with edison again next thursday to try to knock some sense into them  the probability of which is low  
if you have any questions  let us know 
best 
jeff
