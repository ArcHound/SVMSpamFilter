subject  re  extension of time period
doug 
i believe that we should also extend the time period for the reference of disputed items on the working capital statement since we may not resolve everything by the  th of december  given the holidays   which by my calculations would be the date for referral of disputed working capital items to the independent auditors  perhaps we could go ahead and build in an extension period for the working capital items that would coincide with the extension for the inventory  let me know what you think  thanks  anne
