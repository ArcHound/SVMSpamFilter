Subject re  vitro
louise 
the following are the differences in npv at   for the vitro project under the three different scenarios you laid out 
  if we keep the plant 
project npv     us     mm
equity investments to project  us     mm
  if we sell to enel  s based on their offer as it was delivered to us on march  of this year
project npv     us     mm
equity investments to project  us     mm  under this scenario we would fund   of the equity required for the project through cod but after giving effect to the cash received up front by enel  we would only be funding   of the equity required from enron which is equal to the us     mm 
  if sell to enel under the restructured proposal to achieve our deconsolidation and earnings objectives 
project npv     us     mm
equity investments to project  us     mm  under this scenario we would fund   of the equity required for the project through cod but after giving effect to the cash received up front by enel  we would only be funding   of the equity required from enron which is equal to the us     mm 
let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to see more details on the three different scenarios 
thanks
