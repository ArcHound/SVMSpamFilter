subject  re  ats warrants
there are    mm ats warrants in two tiers  one is a tier of    mm with an exercise of    cad that expires     the second is    mm with an exercise price of    cad that expire     the are valued using the black  scholes by shona wilson  s group  the model is signed off on by jean mrha  ats is publicly traded  current value on the gl is   k usd  this is after a  rd qtr write down of   k usd  i would think they should contact shona  s group if the model that is used to value the warrants does not capture the true value

bit of an issue here  i had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature  i really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market 
we also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high 
please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them 
thanks

i do not think it is possible to begin selling the ats warrants at this time 
per the ats warrant certificate  the ats common shares issuable on exercise of the warrants may not be sold  transferred or otherwise traded until march     the warrants are also non  transferable except to an affiliate 
in addition  the ats warrants are valued daily using a black  scholes model  the spreadsheet with the result of the evaluation is attached  the current value of the warrants is     usd using the evaluation model  however  the current ats stock price on the canadian venture exchange is     c with an warrant exercise price of     c for the first      share tranche  the second      share tranche has an exercise price of     c  thus  the current value is considerably less than the black  scholes evaluation model is calculating 

if you have any questions please give me a call at extension
