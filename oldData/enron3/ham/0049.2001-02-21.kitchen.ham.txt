Subject charter review  final version
attached is the final version of the charter review for our meeting with skilling tomorrow  i intended to get this out sooner  but preparations for our energy tech conference tomorrow kept me fairly occupied this afternoon 
i need to go through one last time with my calculator  but do not anticipate there will be any additional revisions  i need to speak at the conference from    to    a  m  tomorrow and will come directly to the  rd floor thereafter  i believe we meet at    a  m  with skilling 
if you need to reach me this evening  my cell number is      
regards
