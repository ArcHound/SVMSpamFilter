executive summary 
 cpuc direct access vote
cpuc
link to  live webcast of cpuc meeting    am    pm sept   th
the sun may be setting on californians  right to customer choice as the cpuc debates the fate of direct access today  we estimate that at this time  the cpuc commissioners will not be taking up the da issue and will instead delay the vote until after the legislature has convened the third special session  called by gov  davis last week  currently  both commissioners brown and wood appear unwilling to support da  with president lynch being a swing vote 
concerning the retroactive suspension of direct access agreements of customers who have already elected alternate service providers  the current cpuc position appears to be that direct access contracts signed by september  th   will not be nullified  there is rumor that the cpuc may be reviewing several of the contracts signed within the past three to nine months  many commercial consumers now operating under da are highly pessimistic about the cpuc supporting da agreements that have been signed within the past three months  the business community is very conscience that the cpuc now bears the difficult task of weighing california businesses  political and economic interests against the economic interests of california  s residential power consumers
