Subject re 
for what ever reason  in the system  he is coded in the executive committee job group  your reports only include job groups of md down to managers  ranabir is coded wrong because he is not an executive committee member and this is why he is not in any of your reports  i will get with is hr rep and get this corrected  if you would like  in the meantime  i can run the report information on him 
thanks  tarsie broussard
