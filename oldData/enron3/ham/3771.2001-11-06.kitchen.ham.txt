subject  inablity to issue l  c increase for    
this has been on hold for some time now  we need to increase the l  c to keep our foreign primary casualty coverage in place  the total value of the l  c would be      it is not much of an increase we need  yet there is zero capacity from the bank to handle our request  failure to act could send a very negative message to the insurance market if we can  t handle this small a request  just thought you should be made aware

i understand the copr need to hold off on all unneccessary requests for l  c  s or funding  we need to be careful not to jeopordize our insurance coverage  the small amout of the l  c coverage increase keeps in place valuable insurance cover  please confirm with jim or paul what the urgency is to ensure we maintain cover  if it needs global finace approvale as well  we can askk for it 
thanks
