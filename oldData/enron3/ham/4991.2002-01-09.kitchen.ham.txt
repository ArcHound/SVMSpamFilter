Subject it infrastructure plan
kim mentioned that you  re on the phone  jenny designated the disaster recovery piece    m  and some other items as capital expenses  and we neglected to include this in our schedule  the total capital budget is     m  i presume that you  ll want to include this amount 
what we currently have is expense plan of    m with a    multiple equals    m 
i think we  ll want to amend it 
   m expense
   m capital
   m total  would you still want a multiple to increase to    m  
we have a call in for en ops as well to make sure that there isn  t any potential capital plan we might need to include 
please let me know
