i have had discussions with bryant  he was disappointed as to the reduction in the equity because as he says  he is in this for the long run   however  i can get him done at current structure if move    to     is that possible  that adds a total of   k over a  year period with   cash     in the first year and   equity     in the back  seems like it should not be a deal breaker
