Subject re  upstream and bridgeline  plan presentation
thank you for sending the revised plans  i tried to make changes to the bridgeline income statement  but could not alter the inputs  as such  please make the following revisions for the  plan column 
originations  
accrual income  bridgeline equity earnings   
other  lrc  napooleonville   
total margin   
capital charge   
total margin net of capital charge    
the capital charge has increased by an approved work order  no  co   of       to complete construction of napoleonville well no    this work was approved in  as part of the original scope of the project and helps to satisfy and finalize ena  s storage capital contribution for bhlp  however  no funding had been allocated to this work order 
there will not be any more capital obligations on enron  s behalf for bridgeline 
since this work order applies to pp  e  i have charged     against the     million   resulting in a capital charge of   thousand  as such  to remain true to approved plan numbers  i have increased originations 
i will not be in the office tomorrow  but i can be reached by cell         in addition  brian redmond should be able to field any questions
