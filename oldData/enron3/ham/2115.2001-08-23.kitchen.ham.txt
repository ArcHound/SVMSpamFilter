 we  re seeing a lot more electronic trading   said ben schlesinger of
maryland  based schlesinger  associates in explaining the causes of the
continued growth   enrononline is still seeing growth and so is ice
   i also think we are seeing a lot more financial
trading as well  there was plenty in the last year or two  but i think one
thing that has continued to change is the real upsurge in the kinds of risk
trading that these guys are offering  that  s a movement that  s likely to
continue in the both the gas and electricity markets  
the largest volume and percentage increases among the top  were shown by
american electric power  bp  mirant  el paso  pancanadian and reliant  aep

boston analyst curt launer told natural gas intelligence   that growth you are
seeing is going to continue  this is an industry which really is only reaching
one third of the market that is out there for it  if you total all of the
things that these companies are doing right now  they really are only
addressing about   billion worth of what is really a north of   billion
u  s  energy market  there  s probably three to five years worth left of
excellent growth because you are going to have a tripling of the market that
these companies address over the next several years before you and i have to
have a conversation about who has a better business model or who really can
gain market share and is doing things better than anyone else
