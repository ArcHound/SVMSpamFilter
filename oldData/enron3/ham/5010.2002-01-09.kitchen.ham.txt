Subject umbrella  netco employee salaries on possible transfer
john 
as discussed  we propose a   adjustment to the base salaries of the under   k employees to be included in the netco offer letters we may produce next week  this is separate from any promotions we may want to make  we will give you a list by friday pm   i have spoken with john and louise and they are in agreement  following our last conversation i believed you also were in agreement  please confirm 
the salary increase will not be communicated as a subsidy for additional benefits costs  but as a modified  streamlined annual base salary review which we would do at this time of year  in the normal course of business

subject  final cost estimates for ssmb benefit transition
attached below is the final estimates for ssmb 
based on a worst case scenario if all ad  d  employee life and spouse life insurances were maxed out it will take     million additional dollars to make every employee whole    over our current annual payroll  
if we only look at employee  s who make less than   k a year we would need     million additional dollars   worst case scenario 
included are all the estimates  rate charts  and salary adjustments 
thanks  tony
