     califor nia contracts get some attention  major earnings week ahead

good morning 
attached  please find the latest issue of our independent power weekly 
summary 
  ipps rise     last week our ipp composite rose      outperforming
both the s  p         and the nasdaq         mirant  which was up     
was the strongest generator in the group  international power was the
weakest performer  declining     
  generation oriented utilities fall     our universe of generation
oriented utilities declined      outperforming both the s  p  and nasdaq 
while underperforming the uty         constellation energy  which was up
     was the strongest performer in the group  black hills was the weakest
performer  declining     
  california contracts dominate investor attention last week there was
some renewed concern among investors that the state of california would
attempt to renegotiate its  power sales contracts with various power
generators and marketers  over the long  term we see minimal risk for the
generators  we believe california has few legal options with respect to
these agreements  further  the signing of these contracts played a key role
in reigning in spot power prices in the state  finally  governor davis
apparently does not support a massive contract renegotiation effort 
  some headline risk remains the only issue we see involves headline
risk  while the governor and his administration appear to be taking a
restrained approach with regard to the contracts  political pressure to
renegotiate continues to grow from the cpuc and the state attorney general  s
office  while we ultimately expect such efforts to be unsuccessful  in the
near term this issue will continue to attract media attention 
  earnings season upon us this week the bulk of the ipp  s and generation
oriented utilities are scheduled to report earnings  in the ipp group 
results are expected from  aes  cpn and rri  in the generation oriented
utility group  results are expected from  cnl  dpl  etr  fpl  ppl and xel 
we expect capital discipline to be a recurring theme emphasized by companies
on their upcoming conference calls  in response to stock prices which are
trading below private market asset values  we expect management teams across
the sector to de  emphasize growth and begin using stricter hurdle rates when
evaluating new investment opportunities 
regards
