subject  extension of petro  canada wholesale gas services arrangement for  more years
on wednesday the president of petro  canada approved the extension of our wholesale gas services agreement after the first term expires november     for an incremental  years  this has taken me a a while to get closed  and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service   but keep in mind it  s not easy to renew something half way through the first term 
this extension is very significant for the following reasons 
  it creates a mtm income of     mm cdn  net of directly attributable costs to provide the back  office services 
  it supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income  along with all the production information etc   
  of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across canada  as you know  we have used the petro  canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide  not only when marketing in canada but also in the us and europe  now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for  years  but they  ve liked it so much they  ve already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term  the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service 
obviously this is a great credit to our commercial staff and the operations  accounting and it staff that work with petro  canada  i will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them  it takes alot of effort to  enchant  the customer day after day  year after year  in fact it  s incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider 
the numbers 
under the extension  we have provided petro  canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee 
original base fee is     mm cdn per year  payable monthly 
rebate offered 
jan    nov         cdn
nov    nov         cdn
fee charged for extension term 
nov    nov         cdn
nov    nov         cdn
nov    nov         cdn
nov    nov         cdn
nov    nov         cdn
we have thoroughly defined our back  office costs required to provide these services at     cdn  yr      and have  years of operating history to support this as a projection  with escalation at   per year  for the second five year term  these costs include back  office staff allocations  salaries and benefits   and rent  infrastructure allocation  we have checked on the allocation of houston costs  and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels  we do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow 
in discussions with wes  this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope  will allow us to mtm this income  the mtm income of     mm cdn includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term  and has been reduced by the above annual costs 
notes 
  we have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with pcog on what our benchmark should be  given that much of the intermediate producers in the group of  have disappeared  we will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to 
  if petro  canada  s sales volumes fall to   of last years levels  there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate  we also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about   of today  s levels  petro  canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected  volumes over the last  months have increased by about     year on year 
  peter and i should have the amended agreement out next week
