the legislature
the assembly version of the senate mou  sb   has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the committee 
it is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at    pm pdt today 
amendments on direct access were released this afternoon  based on negotiations between davis  office and business customers  
customers who have consistently been da since may   including those  involuntarily  returned to bundled service  would be exempt from charges for edison  s undercollection  dwr  s forward contracts  and dwr  related exit fees  provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison  s remaining customers 
customers who have consistently been on da between may  and jan    would be exempt from charges for edison  s undercollection  dwr  s forward contracts and dwr  realted exit fees  provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison  s remaining customers 
customers who have been on da between jan    and august    would be exempt from exit fees related to dwr forward contracts  provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison  s remaining customers 
customer  s leaving after august  th would not qualify for exemptions 
there is considerable work underway to make the august  th date the deadline for contract execution  rather than the date by which the customer must be dasr  d  in order to qualify for the exemptions 
direct access would not be suspended  however  until  days after the bill is signed by davis  if he signs it   i  e   the  effective date  of the bill 
so anyone going to direct access between aug  and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions 
after the   day period  da would be suspended until      
self  gen in service consistently from may  to august  would be exempt from edison  s undercollection and dwr charges 
self  gen that submitted an application to the energy commission by august  would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the self  gen comes on line 
self  gen that comes on line after august  would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the self  gen comes on line  but the total number of exempt mws in this category would be limited to  mws per year  on a first  come  first  serve basis 
at least   of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen
