louise 
we  ve negotiated an mou with alstom that has helped us fix the purchase price for cfb based power plants  it does not commit us to spend any money today  it  s really just a strong guideline for what the epc will look like 
having said that  alstom considers it a big deal  and they are flying in some heavies from paris for the signing ceremony  the guy below is the lead person from paris  additionally  fritz gautschi  alstom  s country president will be coming 
bottom line  it  s tentatively scheduled for the morning of  october here in houston  if you and dave are available  i  ll coordinate  you won  t need to sign  just provide some presence  there  s still some flexibility if that day doesn  t work for you 
thanks
