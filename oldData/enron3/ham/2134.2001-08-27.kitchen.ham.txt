good morning 
attached  please find the latest issue of our independent power weekly 
also note that on september  and   csfb will host a power generation

cpn  mir  nrg  orn  rri and te 
  ipps rise     last week our ipp composite rose      outperforming
both the nasdaq        and the s  p          this was the strongest
performance for our composite since the second week of july  calpine  which
was up      was the strongest performer in the group  global power
equipment group was the weakest performer  falling     
  recognition of attractive valuations and cpn conference call boost stock
prices we attribute last week  s performance to a growing recognition that
the group is simply oversold  indeed  on average the pure play ipps are
trading at    x  eps  which represents a    valuation compression
year to date  more immediately  we believe a conference call hosted by
calpine on monday      helped ease investor concerns regarding the
supply  demand outlook for the sector and the ability of power generators to
attract capital to grow their businesses 
  calpine hosting final special topic conference call on tuesday      
calpine will conclude its special topic conference call series with a
discussion of the california power market  the call will take place at  pm
edt  the dial  in number is       on the call  management will
provide a regulatory update and describe the steps it has taken to respond
to the power shortages in the state 
  california windfall profits tax bill resurfaces today       the
california assembly revenue and taxation committee will consider sb  xx  the
power generator windfall profits tax bill  importantly  while earlier
versions of the bill implied that the tax would be retroactive and applied
to power sales going back to january     the current version of the
bill suggests that the tax will not be implemented until early   in
addition  an internal analysis of the bill done by the assembly revenue and
taxation committee suggests that the bill could be subject to several legal
challenges if it is passed
