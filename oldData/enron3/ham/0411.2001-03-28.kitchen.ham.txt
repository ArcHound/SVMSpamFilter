 day payments through april 
standard eei payment terms thereafter

ena has right to walk at any time for any reason up until the earlier of  days after bonds issued or sep 
cal reg out  with termination payment  modified to include ballott initiatives and cpuc orders
this is effectively a   mm premium for a  mmmwhr put swaption
