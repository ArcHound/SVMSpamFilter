Subject re  so
going going gone  he was bitter and uncurable 
left calpine  and a bunch of options     years ago
did great his first year
floundered last year
joined my group in january  felt like he got screwed by presto and jacoby
never got any traction in my group
he will be a better counterparty  left on good terms  not sure where he  s going yet
