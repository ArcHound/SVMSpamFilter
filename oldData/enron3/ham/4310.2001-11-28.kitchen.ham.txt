from michele davis  assistant treasury secretary for public
affairs  on enron corp  dynegy inc  abandoned a takeover bid for
enron today  leaving the country  s largest energy trader without
enough cash to pay its   billion in debt  treasury securities
rose after the decision was announced as investors dumped stocks
and moved money into the safety of government debt

enron bonds may be good buy for patient investors  analysts say
new york  nov    bloomberg    enron corp  debt  which
plunged by half today after its credit rating was cut to junk and
rival dynegy inc  abandoned a planned buyout of the company  may
reward investors willing to hold the bonds while enron sells
assets through a bankruptcy proceeding  analysts said 
enron  s notes and bonds dipped to as low as  cents on the
dollar today after standard  poor  s cut enron  s rating six levels
to   b     the firm  s debt issues  which have a combined face
value of more than   billion according to bloomberg data  traded
mostly between  cents and  cents this afternoon 
analysts expect enron to file for bankruptcy protection 
which would put bondholders in line with banks and other creditors
for enron  s cash and any proceeds from asset sales  under that
scenario  bondholders could get back between  cents and  cents
on the dollar within three years  said stephen ardizzoni  junk 
bond portfolio manager at smh capital advisors 
  you should have a pretty decent return at these purchase
prices    said ardizzoni  who said he bought some enron notes
maturing in  and bonds maturing in  for between  cents
and  cents on the dollar today 
bondholders may end up with less if it turns out there are
fewer assets or more liabilities than the company  s balance sheet
now shows  ardizzoni said  enron has drawn fire for its disclosure
practices  which in recent weeks included revelations of a    
billion reduction in shareholder equity and an early repayment
date on a   million note 
like a broker
owners of enron debt may recover  cents on the dollar
within two years  mostly from proceeds of sales of enron  s
pipelines  international assets  and real estate  said jon kyle
cartwright  who follows enron  s debt for raymond james 
associates inc 
enron  once the biggest energy trader  made most of its money
buying and selling electricity and natural gas  the company can be
likened to a broker because hiring and retaining high  performing
employees and developing relationships is more important than
owning physical assets  cartwright said 
  the real value of a broker is with their clients and
personnel  there typically is minimal post  bankruptcy value   
said cartwright  enron  s trading business doesn  t have much more
to offer than   office space and the artwork on the walls   in a
bankruptcy proceeding  he said 
marty whitman will consider enron bonds for the   billion he
helps manage at third avenue funds in new york  still  the   year 
old investor  who specializes in analyzing distressed securities 
prefers to invest in debt that  s secured by assets 
said whitman    i never did understand their trading

new york  nov    bloomberg    jon kyle cartwright  a
senior vice president and senior energy analyst who follows enron
corp  for raymond james  associates inc  in st  petersburg 
florida  comments on enron  s outlook after the company  s credit
ratings were cut to junk status and dynegy inc  abandoned a
takeover bid for the company 
  this is a disaster    cartwright said    i don  t know how
they can  t file   for protection from creditors    enron isn  t a
going concern 
  it is difficult  if not impossible  for anyone to do trades
with enron  s trading operations in light of junk ratings across
the board and dynegy walking away from the deal 
  no trading  no cash flow  no cash flow  no enron   
cartwright said he thought the company had two months to sort
out its problems and had a buy on the debt when it initially
  blew up 
  it was a credibility crisis the company could manage in two
months  i  m sure they are in talks with their bankers right now 
but i doubt if their bankers could even help them    he said 
  if any  energy  trader does business with enron right now 
it is a career decision 
  it will be hard for energy traders to re  adjust to a world
without enron 
  this was a self  fulfilling prophecy  it doesn  t often
happen that a company has a credibility crisis during a recession 
in a bear market    cartwright said 
  hopefully  what comes out of the ashes of this is an
entirely new group of analysts that will follow what will now be a
bigger growth business   energy trading 
  all of the smaller energy traders are about to become much
bigger  and the market has to learn how to analyze these things as
brokerage firms

comments made today by michael aguirre  a partner with san diego 
based law firm aguirre in both 
and   it had been less than a majority 
participants in the plan  which had     billion in assets
available for benefits  could only do so much to diversify their
investments  enron  like many other companies  used stock rather
than cash to match employee contributions and restricted sales of
the shares 
and they could only guess at the year  end makeup of the plan  s
assets until the end of june  reflecting sec disclosure standards
for savings plans  by that time  the stock  s drop   which reached
 percent today   was already well under way 
trio of lawsuits
enron later reported     billion in third  quarter charges 
ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow  who ran partnerships
that accounted for some of the charges  restated its results since
  became the target of an sec accounting investigation  and
accepted a takeover bid from dynegy inc   its biggest rival 
the company  s shares  which ended last year at      closed
at just  cents today as enron  s debt was downgraded to junk  bond
status and dynegy abandoned its offer 
in response to the plunge  employees in the   k  plan  
which allows workers to defer part of their pay and build tax  free
savings  and takes its name from a section of the internal revenue
service code   have filed three lawsuits against enron 
the suits allege  among other things  that the houston  based
company prevented employees from shifting investments within the
plan between oct    the day after its disclosure of the charges 
and nov   as the company made administrative changes 
all three seek class  action status on behalf of the plan  s
participants  the most recent filing came from the gottesdiener law
firm  based in washington  on monday  it covers the longest time
period  november  to now 
falling percentages
enron shares accounted for  percent of the savings plan  s
assets at the end of   the year before the period associated
with the gottesdiener suit began  the figure reflected a one  time
company contribution of preferred stock  and rose from  percent
in  
each preferred share has a face value of   and is
convertible into    common shares  this translates into a
conversion price of     a share  a bargain before the common
tumbled  percent today 
the plan also owned a stake in enron  s former oil and gas unit 
which became eog resources inc  after gaining independence in  
add in those shares  and company stock represented about two  thirds
of the  assets 
enron  s common and preferred shares fell to  percent of
  k  assets available for benefits in    percent in 
and  percent in  as the u  s  stock market rallied  lifting
the value of participants  investments in equity mutual funds 
the shares represented  percent of the plan  s assets in
  the proportion hit bottom at  percent in   when the
assets more than doubled   exceeding the  percent increase in
enron  s share price that year   to     billion 
how much choice

best performance in more than two decades even as u  s  stocks

trader facing bankruptcy 
enron shares plunged  percent to below   on concern the
company can  t repay its   billion in debt  dynegy withdrew after
bankers failed to raise     billion enron needed to operate until
the acquisition was completed  credit rating companies lowered
enron  s rating to junk 
  the reality is enron  s going bankrupt    said michael
willingham  a risk manager at itochu international inc   a unit of
a japanese trading firm    enron touted themselves as the king of
risk management  but it doesn  t look like they  ve managed their
risk very well   
enron  s sudden collapse     billion of market value
evaporated in seven weeks   deals a blow to alliance capital
management holdings llp and other big mutual funds  wall street
lenders  such as j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup inc   and
the    employees  many of whom were relying on shares of the
houston  based company for their retirement 
bankers led by j  p  morgan chase vice chairman james b  lee
tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed  investors
including saudi prince alwaleed bin talal  the blackstone group lp
and the carlyle group inc  turned them down because of concern
enron would default  that concern was heightened after enron
disclosed it had a   million payment due this week 
enron shares declined     to  cents in trading of more
than  million shares  the most traded ever for a u  s  stock 
the company  s    percent bonds  which mature in   were quoted
as low as  cents on the dollar  down from  yesterday  at that
price the bonds yield  percent 
termination
dynegy said it abandoned the takeover   due to breaches by
enron of representations  warrants  and covenants    chief
executive officer chuck watson said dynegy invoked its right to
purchase enron  s northern natural gas pipeline  dynegy received
the right to do so in exchange for an investment of     billion
in enron by chevrontexaco corp   which owns one quarter of dynegy 
the unit operates    miles of natural gas pipeline 
  sometimes the best deals are the ones you do not do    said
watson  who two weeks earlier had sealed the acquisition over
coffee and muffins in the kitchen of enron ceo ken lay  s houston
home    we felt we had no choice but to act to protect our
shareholders  interest    watson said 
as the news of dynegy  s rejection flashed across computer
screens on enron  s trading floor in houston  some employees
started to abandon their desks and leave the office  an enron
trader said  several workers said they expect the company to begin
firing workers tomorrow to prepare for bankruptcy 
  we will work to retain the employees necessary to the
continuing operations of our trading and other core energy
businesses    said lay in a statement  lay was a big backer of
george w  bush  s campaign for presidency and said he had held
discussions about a job in administration at one point 
enron said in a statement it would halt all payments other
than those required to continue trading operations and would
review dynegy  s   assertion   that it is entitled to the pipeline
unit 
pipeline company
from its start as natural gas pipeline company in the  s 
enron was transformed by then ceo jeffrey skilling into the
largest competitor in the business of trading energy  mainly
natural gas and electric power  under skilling  the company also
sought to expand into internet trading for products ranging from
metals to weather derivatives  skilling resigned in august 
enron shares tripled in the two years ended december  
peaking at a market value of more than   billion  as the company
snared     billion in long  term energy management contracts from
companies such as international business machines corp  and
starwood hotels  resorts worldwide inc  in the first quarter of
  enron  s profit from operations rose  percent to  
million and revenue quadrupled to   billion 
enron began to unravel in october after it said shareholders
equity was reduced by     billion because it used stock to pay
off debt of a partnership run by then chief financial officer
andrew fastow  the announcement led to lawsuits and a probe by the
securities and exchange commission  the writedown also raised
questions about how enron accounted for debt and losses of similar
affiliated partnerships  on nov    it restated earnings back to
  lowering them by   million 
as its shares plunged  enron faced a cash crunch because
lenders and some trading partners lost confidence the company
would have the cash to pay bills  citigroup and j  p  morgan chase
offered to pony up   million each out   billion the company
sought  trading partners such as mirant corp  were less
forgiving  demanding more collateral or restricting trading 
enrononline  enron corp   s online trading system  stopped
allowing trades and quit posting bids and offers for natural gas
this morning  say traders who use the web site  enron said
yesterday that enrononline handled about  percent of its trading
business  or about     billion a day 
  we can log in  but there is nothing there  nothing to buy

lower credit ratings
s  p cut its rating on enron to   b    from   bbb    and
moody  s lowered its rating to   b    from   baa     both ratings
are below investment grade  the downgrade is significant because
the reduction to junk may require enron to repay     billion 
andre meade  an analyst at commerzbank securities  said that
enron  s junk credit rating would   effectively shut down the bulk
of their trading and marketing operations   
  it  s not likely enron will be able to raise the capital to
settle those payments and continue its business    said meade 
the large debts make it unlikely that investors will receive
much should the company file for bankruptcy  said investors 
  this will be a traditional bankruptcy in which equity
holders get nothing    said edward paik  who has    million enron
shares among   billion in assets he helps manage for liberty
funds group    this company doesn  t have the safety net in terms
of assets that other companies do

bid for the company 
the company is struggling with a cash crunch as at least    
billion in debt comes due immediately because of the rating cut 
and is suspending its online trading unit and some   non  core  
payments  enron  s trading business is also faltering as trading
partners lose faith in the company  s ability to meet its
obligations 
  this is a disaster    said jon kyle cartwright  a debt
analyst at raymond james  associates    it is difficult  if not
impossible  for anyone to do trades with enron  s trading
operations in light of junk ratings across the board and dynegy
walking away from the deal   
s  p cut enron  s long  term credit rating this morning six
levels to   b    from   bbb    and withdrew its   a   short  term
grade 
s  p analyst todd shipman  the author of the rating report 
said the rating could be lowered if enron  s cash situation isn  t
resolved  and that a move to a chapter  bankruptcy filing and
the lowest   d   rating were both possibilities 
  we saw the deterioration in the trading operations  and
that threw the merger in doubt    he said  he said s  p may change
the rating soon 
following suit
moody  s followed s  p with a five  level cut in enron  s credit
rating to   b    from   baa     moody  s affirmed its   not  prime  
rating on enron  s commercial paper 
fitch lowered enron  s senior unsecured rating  levels  to
  cc   from   bbb     and its short  term rating to its second 
lowest   c   from   f     fitch said in its report that a
  default of some kind appears probable   
egan  jones ratings co  cut enron  s credit rating to junk on
oct    when it lowered it one level to   bb    from   bbb    
the rating company downgraded the credit several times since then 
and cut it to   c   today 
s  p  moody  s and fitch all had enron  s credit rating three
levels above junk in january  while egan  jones rated it four
levels higher 
the companies cut the ratings several times since october 
amid news that enron  s dealings with partnerships run by former
chief financial officer andy fastow contributed to trading losses 
enron reported     billion in third  quarter losses from failed
investments 
pressure
the acquisition by dynegy promised to alleviate the ensuing
cash crunch  enron  s stock fell by more than  percent since nov 
 amid growing skepticism that the dynegy would complete the
acquisition 
  we became a lot more concerned when the stock didn  t
stabilize    said john diaz  moody  s managing director for energy
and one of the authors of the downgrade report    the drop in the
stock price put pressure on dynegy to renegotiate the deal   
enron has     billion of debt outstanding  according to
bloomberg data  its shares  which have fallen  percent this
year  lost     today to  cents  the company  s bonds dropped by
about half to  cents on the dollar from  cents 
s  p  s shipman said in his report that   the willingness of
dynegy to complete its planned acquisition of enron has been
compromised by the continued drop in confidence in the capital
markets that the transaction would hold   
credit analysts also focused on enron  s cash flow levels 
diaz said  enron said in its most recent filing last week that it
had   billion in cash  which was a lot less than the market had
expected  diaz said 
  it came as a surprise to us and to others    he said    we
expected at least     billion so they would have staying power

  the likely bankruptcy will generate material losses for a

  some counterparty credit defaults will also have some

on swap desks  many of these counterparties could delay or manage

  a chapter  reorganization would be the only way that

company  which is paying     million annually for  years to
have its name on the astros  home ballpark  enron field 
  we identify with enron  and they identify with us    smith
said    there  s no negative association because of their

enron  the u  s   s biggest energy trader  entered into the

since then  the company  s fortunes have plummeted  the
company has   billion in debt and not enough cash to pay it 
dynegy abandoned its plan to buy its houston neighbor for at least

enron also has a contract to supply and manage energy for the
baseball stadium for the next  years  said dean bonham  a denver 
based consultant who analyzes and sells naming rights agreements 
  this is more than a naming rights deal    bonham said 
  they  re going to eventually have to find another company to
supply that service as well as put their name on the ballpark

are comments by california power authority chairman s  david
freeman on dynegy inc   s decision to abandon its purchase of enron
corp  and the possibility of enron filing for chapter 
bankruptcy protection 
  i don  t think that trading of energy in the spot market is
going to be materially affected by this  there are a lot of other
people who will take up the slack   
  i see this as an indication that a very volatile market can
kill the consumer  but it can also kill one of the companies   
  it  s a fascinating footnote that a year ago it was the
state of california that appeared to be on the verge of
bankruptcy  at least some of the utilities were  and now the shoe
has kind of dropped on the other foot   
  i take no pleasure in this at all  i don  t view this as a
happy or good thing  but when you live by the sword  sometimes you
die by the sword

downgrade  and as major u  s  stock indexes declined  at  basis
points above the   year treasury yield  the   year swap spread
has risen  basis points from a three year low two weeks ago 
today  s move was  in part  a reaction to concerns about exposure

seeking yield
the fed  s ten interest  rate cuts this year helped encourage
investors to seek higher yields from top investment  grade
borrowers including at  t corp  and american express co  the fed  s
cuts also depressed already  low rates on money  market funds and
certificates of deposit 
the price on enron  s    percent notes maturing in

the company  s enrononline internet  based platform for trading
natural gas  power and oil stopped functioning this morning  at

enron shares have fallen  percent this year  wiping out
about     billion in market value  investors lost     billion
today alone as the stock plunged      or  percent  to  cents
a share 
the stock has posted the biggest decline in the standard 
poor  s  index this year  meaning fund managers with over  
trillion invested in portfolios that try to mimic the benchmark
have followed the stock down 
enron  s decline today prompted standard  poor  s to kick the
company out of the s  p   used by most professional investors as
a benchmark for u  s  stocks  the company will be removed when the
market closes tomorrow 
index managers  who mimic the makeup of the s  p as closely as
possible  will sell at that time  other investors are likely to
sell as well  if they haven  t already  because money managers who
pick stocks based on their evaluation of a company  s earnings
prospects often prefer to stick to stocks that are in the index to
ensure their performance doesn  t lag the benchmark

dropped to     so about  percent of the people in the market

it was one of the top five busiest days we  ve had  we  re up about
 percent in terms of our trading volumes over the last  days

enron to continue utility sale to northwest natural  update  
 adds northwest natural comment in fourth  fifth paragraphs  
portland  oregon  nov    bloomberg    enron corp   the
nearly bankrupt energy trader  plans to go through with the sale
of its portland general electric co  utility unit to northwest
natural gas co   both companies said 
enron last month agreed to sell pge to northwest natural for
    billion in cash  stock and assumed debt  dynegy inc  today
called off its planned purchase of enron  saying the energy trader
breached covenants in the merger agreement  dynegy had supported
the pge sale 
northwest natural filed its application to buy pge with the
oregon public utility commission today  in the application 
northwest natural said combining its operations with pge would
eventually result in savings of as much as   million a year 
northwest natural will   have to study   the potential impact
of enron  s latest problems  northwest chairman and chief executive
officer richard g  reiten said  he said he expects the acquisition
to move forward 
  we believe it only underscores the merits of the
acquisition of pge by northwest natural    reiten said in a
conference call with analysts 
enron spokeswoman karen denne said her company has no plans
to call off the sale 
  we are proceeding with our previously announced asset
sales  including portland general    denne said 
northwest natural shares fell  cents to      enron
shares fell     to  cents  enron shares have dropped 
percent since the first of the year 
commission  s role
marc hellman  the administrator responsible for mergers and
acquisitions at the oregon public utility commission  said he is
unsure what would happen if enron were to file for bankruptcy
protection 
  i can  t recall it ever happening  and i  ve been here for
 years    hellman said    if it went all the way to the end 
where they  re liquidating assets  you can  t sell utility property
without commission approval  there are probably some issues where
our attorney general  s office may look into it   
hellman said he has heard nothing to indicate northwest
natural  s purchase of pge wouldn  t go forward 
  enron was getting cash from northwest natural for the
purchase  as well as shares    hellman said    that aspect of the
transaction becomes a little curious if enron is going through
bankruptcy   
debt downgrades
moody  s investors service today downgraded pge  s senior
secured debt to   a    from   a     moody  s also downgraded pge  s
unsecured debt  its junior subordinated debt and its preferred
stock  moody  s  standard  poor  s and fitch inc  cut enron  s
credit rating to junk status today 
the ratings service said it had expected to downgrade pge  s
ratings once northwest natural completed its acquisition of the
utility 
  however  today  s rating action is being taken in advance of
the expected closing of that transaction to reflect moody  s
concerns surrounding portland general  s ability to remain fully
insulated from the many financial challenges currently being faced
by its parent  enron corp   due in large part to lost investor
confidence in enron    moody  s said in a statement

as did citigroup  s salomon smith barney investment banking unit

after standard  poor  s corp  downgraded enron debt to junk  for
both banks  the takeover would have been the year  s third largest 
it ranked eighth among all announced takeovers this year 
  sometimes the best deals are the ones you do not do   
dynegy chairman charles watson said in a conference call    we
know how to say no  and we did that   
the deal  s implosion today  with enron shares at  cents 
capped an epic that saw the houston  based company turn itself from
a natural gas pipeline carrier into the largest u  s  energy trader
into an outfit with debts of   billion it couldn  t pay 
enron  s plunge
enron stock began plunging in october   after falling from
its     peak   with the disclosure of a securities and
exchange commission probe into how the company accounted for
outside partnerships it created 
even before dynegy made its bid on nov    citigroup and j  p

make calls to keep the energy trader  s credit above junk rating

group lp 
the collapsed transaction may tarnish citigroup and j  p 
morgan over a questionable strategy of extending commercial
lending power to clients to gain higher  margin investment banking
business  analysts said  each bank was formed when a commercial
bank took over an investment bank 
behind the formation of the larger banks was the notion they
could attract investment banking business from stand  alone
investment banks such as goldman sachs group inc  and morgan
stanley dean witter  co  that are limited in what they can lend 
it was a strategy that failed  at great cost  when the enron 
dynegy merger fell apart 
as the purchase was still taking shape  goldman sachs
refused to lend to enron  a client whose credit rating was now
falling and who was making less frequent use of goldman  s
investment banking services  according to people familiar with the
matter 
bankruptcy is  inevitable 
morgan stanley avoided enron because it was perceived as too
demanding a client and one that played investment banks off each
other to reduce fees  a person familiar with the matter said 
lehman brothers holdings inc  advised dynegy and negotiated a
fee of about   million 
enron  the worst performer this year in the standard  poor  s
index of  large u  s  companies  fell     or  percent  to

trading screens became useless about  a  m  new york time 
around when dynegy inc  canceled plans to buy enron  the decision
may force enron  once the country  s largest energy trader  to file
for chapter  bankruptcy protection  analysts said  enron was the
buyer or seller of all transactions over enrononline 
the company said yesterday that enrononline handled about 
percent of its trading business  or about     billion a day in
trading on average over the past  days  the halt in service left
users unable to value or make trades  some switched to competitors
such as atlanta  based intercontinental exchange inc   an online
exchange run by a consortium of banks and energy companies 
  we can log in  but there is nothing there  nothing to buy
and nothing to sell   at enrononline  said juha laiho  an energy
trader at finland  based fortum oyj in houston 
leslie vandagriff  manager of natural gas trading at highland
energy co   was sitting at her desk in dallas when   everything
went blank    vandagriff was using enrononline prices to compare
the value of trades she was making with other companies  she
switched to prices published by the intercontinental exchange 
no future 
enron temporarily suspended   all payments other than those
necessary to maintain core operations    the company said in a
statement  enron officials didn  t return numerous phone calls
seeking comment on the status of enrononline 
when the news of the collapse of the acquisition reached
enron traders  many left the trading floor saying that without
dynegy  they had no future  an enron trader said 
traders outside the company had already been wary of making
new contracts with enron because of concern about its credit
rating  which today was slashed to junk status by standard 
poor  s and moody  s investors service 
  i don  t think anybody is trading with enron right now   
fortum oyj  s laiho said    even late last week  people were not
making new positions with them  it was an unstable situation   
small exposure
some of enron  s biggest trading partners said their exposure
to losses from an enron bankruptcy is small 
el paso corp   owner of the biggest u  s pipeline network  and
american electric power co   the biggest electricity generator 
and aquila inc   an energy trader  said each faced a possible loss
of   million  mirant corp  said it wouldn  t lose more than  
million  and dynegy said its exposure was limited to   million 
  i don  t anticipate a string of bankruptcies to follow this
one    said tim evans  senior energy analyst at ifr pegasus in new
york 
  the energy markets are bigger than any one company 
including enron    american electric spokesman pat hemlepp said 
  we don  t expect any disruption   
energy buyers and sellers have been concerned for weeks that
enron  s financial problems may disrupt markets such as the new
york mercantile exchange  the largest energy marketplace  enron is
the largest trader of natural gas 
  if they have to go to bankruptcy protection now  which may
even happen by the end of the day  then nymex positions will have
to be liquidated    said ed silliere  vice president of risk
management at energy merchant llc in new york 
the nymex is   very comfortable that all of our customers are
safe from any financial losses suffered by a single entity   
spokeswoman nachamah jacobovits said when asked about enron 
cover for losses
enron  s positions in futures markets are guaranteed first by
the member  or members  that clear its trades on the exchange  if
the clearing member couldn  t cover losses  the exchange has a  
million guarantee fund  followed by another   million that it
could draw on from other members 
while natural gas futures surged as much as  percent after
the news of dynegy  s pullout  prices later declined  percent on
the nymex  gas for december delivery fell  cents to     per
million british thermal units 
financial safeguards like those on the nymex aren  t available
in most over  the  counter energy markets  including forward and
swaps transactions  few transactions have the backing of an
intermediary 
  this will have a near  term chilling effect on forward
energy trading business    said tom knight  director of trading at
truman arnold cos   a wholesale fuel supplier in texarkana  texas 
  if you  re not willing to trade with a company that was the size
of enron  then who are the companies you are going to be willing
to deal with   
other exchanges
other online energy exchanges benefited as traders avoided
doing business with enron 
ngx canada inc   an internet exchange for natural gas in
canada  has traded about    terajoules of gas so far this
month  worth about   million at current prices  trading is
about  percent higher than in october 
  yesterday was our third or fourth best day ever    said dan
zaftawny  a spokesman for ngx  which is owned by om gruppen ab 
parent of the stockholm stock exchange 
another beneficiary has been atlanta  based intercontinental
exchange  which is owned by a consortium that includes aep  bp
plc  duke energy corp  and goldman sachs group inc 
  it was a very big trading day on ice    said jeffrey
sprecher  intercontinental  s chief executive officer    we  re up
about  percent in terms of our trading volumes over the last

so there  s a lot of growth we  ve been trying to digest in the last
 days  much of which is attributable to problems at enron
