london  afx   enron corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by    bln usd as the company decided to repurchase  mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer  andrew fastow  the wall street journal reported in its online edition 
enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on tuesday  when the houston  based energy giant announced a    bln usd charge to third  quarter earnings that produced a  mln usd loss 
however  the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday  as a result of the reduction  enron  s shareholder equity dropped to    bln usd  the company said 
in an interview  enron chairman kenneth lay said about  mln usd of the    bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with ljm  co  investment lp  a limited partnership created and run by fastow 
in a conference call yesterday with investors  lay said  mln shares had been repurchased by enron  as the company  unwound  its participation in the transactions  in the third quarter  the company  s average number of shares outstanding was  mln 
according to rick causey  enron  s chief accounting officer  these shares were contributed to a  structured finance vehicle  set up about two years ago in which enron and ljm  were the only investors  in exchange for the stock  the entity provided enron with a note 
the aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of enron  s broadband telecommunications and other technology investments  causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took 
subsequently  both the value of enron  s stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply  the report said  as a result  enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares  when enron reacquired the shares  it also canceled the note it had received from the entity 
given all the complexities of the ljm  related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company   the confusion factor wasn  t worth the trouble of trying to continue this   causey said 
mark palmer  an enron spokesman  described the capital reduction  as just a balance  sheet issue  and therefore was not deemed  material  for disclosure purposes

usa  enron  s stock slides as equity reduction digested

 c  reuters limited  
houston  oct   reuters   enron corp  stock fell sharply on thursday as investors digested news of a     billion reduction in the energy giant  s shareholder equity that attracted little attention when it was first disclosed earlier this week 
in afternoon trading enron  s stock was off     or     percent at     per share 
enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years on tuesday after taking charges of     billion against earnings to cover expenses and writedowns on investments that fall outside its core wholesale energy operations 
the reduction in shareholder equity was not mentioned in the company  s earnings statement but was discussed by chairman and chief executive ken lay in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors on tuesday 
 confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure  this is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much   said one analyst who asked not to be identified 
the reduction in equity was prominently reported in the wall street journal on thursday  bringing it to the attention of a wider audience  analysts said 
lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some wall street analysts 
as a result of the operation  enron  s debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about  percent  but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around  percent by the end of next year  lay said 
moody  s investor service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron  s long  term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several enron businesses 
some of enron  s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings
