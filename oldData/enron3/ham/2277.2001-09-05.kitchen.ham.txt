subject  fw  power generation  a regional analysis of supply and
demandin the us power market
 

good evening 
 attached  please find an abridged version of our   page report in which
 we provide our supply and demand outlook for  regions across the us 

 summary 
   the power markets are regional in nature the fragmented us
 transmission system results in significant regional power pricing and
 economic disparities  in order to fully understand this industry  macro
 analyses of the us market must be supplemented with an in  depth assessment
 of its individual regions 
   announced projects cannot be taken at face value out of the   
 mw of project announcements we have identified  only   are actually
 under construction  our base case analysis suggests that only  
     mw  of the announced projects will be completed 
   shortages will persist in several key markets owing to a combination
 of current supply shortages  capacity retirements and demand growth  we
 estimate that the entire us will need    new mws by  in order to
 achieve an equilibrium   capacity margin  this requirement is   above
 our base case buildout forecast  consequently  we project a  capacity
 shortfall of    mw  our analysis indicates that supply shortages will
 be most pronounced in the mid  atlantic  new york  parts of the midwest 
 and the southeast 
   positive implications for generators our findings have positive
 implications for selected generators  we believe that calpine  cpn 
 strong buy   entergy  etr  buy   mirant  mir  buy   nrg energy  nrg  buy  
 ppl corp   ppl  buy   and reliant resources  rri  buy  are best positioned
 within this market
