Subject i finally was able to implement the new factors for power  now know as project x  if you have time  i would like to give you a down load on the work involved the last few months cleaning things up  overall var is reduced  i  ve included some highlights below 
 changed correlation measure to fixed contract instead of using prompt price history
 extended factors out past prompt month to  months  power only    previously was for prompt month only 
o repeating last  months  seasonality  for  months  and scaled by ff vol
 updated jumps from   impacts intra month books 
o introduced regionally correlated jumps
 mapped f curves to appropriate r and b curves
 captured gas leg in spread option
 captured gas leg in heat rate swaps
 corrected incorrect curve codes and data input relating to risk type
 as of sept

power total    
additionally  items on our to do list for the future include 
  smoothing of ffvol curve
  introducing more factors to model      improving correlations and decreasing var instability 
as an aside  we are looking at trying to introduce a fast fourier transformation to improve var modeling  allowing us to increase number and accuracy of simulations 
in closing  this project could not have been completed without the help of the stephen stock  s it team  the power traders  tanya tamarchenko  jaesoo lew  stacey white  casey evans  naveen andrews  michael presley and donnie vinson 
i appreciate your patience  i realize it has been a long haul 
thanks
