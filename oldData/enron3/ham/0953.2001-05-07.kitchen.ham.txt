Subject re  current drafts of highstar  ena documents
stuart 
per our discussion of earlier this afternoon  i am forwarding a series of e  mails that contain the latest drafts of the three principal documents   the spa  the asset management agreement  and the brokerage agreement   as well as the schedules  exhibits to the spa  the spa and the schedules  exhibits are ena  s latest drafts and the other two documents are aig  milbank tweed  s  responses 
heather kroll and i plan to meet at bracewell tomorrow morning at    a  m  the aig  milbank folks are expected to arrive around     and we believe you could provide valuable input should you be in a position to attend on such short notice 
as you will see from the milbank markups a number of significant issues remain  for example  their addition of  ii  to section   c  of the brokerage agreement shows that aig has yet to agree that ect securities liability for performance defaults should be limited to termination 
its going to be an interesting week  glad to have your insight 
steve
