after consulting with the personnel of the remote team  we have assessed their needs  and are prepared to begin the initial swap  out of crts for flat panels to the various locations 
our first targets are toronto     flats  and calgary     flats  
as we receive more through additional moves  we will include portland  new york  chicago  and other locations as needed 
i just need to know that everyone  s okay for us to begin this process  thanks
