new york   dow jones    an internet  based energy and metals trading operation  saw record trading volumes last week  due in part to troubles at enron corp   ene   an ice press release said tuesday  without mentioning enron by name 
investors have been watching to see if enron  s trading partners in its core business  north american gas and power marketing  significantly reduce activities with the financially troubled top energy marketer  ice is considered a primary alternative to enron  s internet  based commodities market  enrononline 
ice  s volume of north american bulk power trades last week totaled a record  million megawatt  hours  a   increase over the october weekly average  north american natural gas volumes rose   from october to  billion cubic feet last week  oil trading rose   to a record  million barrels  and metals trading volumes was up   
 we believe that this has resulted  in part  from the uncertainty that has been exhibited in several key energy trading venues over the pas several months   said ice chief executive  jeffry sprecher 
enrononline is different from ice because enrononline is a mechanism for companies to buy from  and sell to  enron  ice is a neutral multiparty exchange  allowing energy trading companies to trade with all other members 
ice  s trading system  which has been installed in    desktops worldwide  covers  commodity and derivative contract types  ice also owns the international petroleum exchange of london  europe  s largest energy futures exchange 
ice is owned by companies including american electric power  aep   aquila energy  ila   bp amoco plc  bp   deutshe bank ag  g  dbk   el paso corp   epg   goldman sachs group  gs   morgan stanley dean witter       mark  golden  dowjones  com

new york    business wire    nov       fitch has lowered portland general electric co   s  pge  securities as follows  senior secured debt to  bbb   from  a   senior unsecured debt to  bbb  from  a    preferred stock to  bbb   from  bbb    the rating watch status has been revised to evolving from negative for all intermediate  to long  term securities  a rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised  lowered or maintained  pge  s commercial paper has been downgraded to  f   from  fl   with a stable outlook 
the downgrades for pge reflect substantial ongoing uncertainty at its parent  enron  ene   ene  s senior unsecured debt is rated  bbb    with a rating watch evolving  ene  s financial flexibility has been severely impaired as a result of recent developments primarily surrounding its investment in structured transactions  on oct      ene announced a   billion after tax charge to third quarter  earnings and a     billion reduction to balance sheet equity relating to the unwinding of structured transactions  in addition  the company has restated its financial results for the    period  incorporating off  balance sheet entries related to the structured transactions and is the subject of a securities and exchange commission  sec  investigation focusing on the company  s accounting for the partnerships 
these events badly eroded investor confidence in the company  effectively blocking its ability to access capital markets  and forcing management to seek a corporate suitor  on nov      dynegy  dyn  announced that it reached a definitive agreement to acquire ene in a stock  for  stock transaction under which ene shareholders will receive a fixed amount of dyn shares  the proposed dyn transaction will provide significant financial support to ene  and should enable ene to fund its cash needs through the first quarter of  under expected business conditions  despite ene  s significant refinancing risk  the merger requires regulatory approvals  including hart  scott  rodino  the sec  and the federal regulatory energy commission  assuming regulators approve the merger  we would expect the transaction to close in six  to nine  months  the merger agreement includes termination provisions that add an element of uncertainty to its completion  fitch anticipates that the surviving company  s rating would move to the mid   bbb  range assuming the successful execution of its interim plans to delever its capital structure and the completion of the merger  if the merger were terminated fitch believes ene  s ability to manage its business would be severely impaired and would expect to downgrade its securities to highly speculative levels 
pge  s new ratings also recognize its strong standalone credit profile  the prospective regulatory ring  fencing required by oregon regulators  and the pending sale of pge to northwestern natural gas  nwn   in addition to its interim status as a subsidiary of ene  the evolving status for pge recognizes that its ratings could drop if the ene  dyn merger were terminated  or improve  if ene  s credit rating is upgraded in the future 
pge  s credit quality ratios and financial strength are expected to temporarily weaken in   reflecting the absence of cash recovery of unusually high wholesale power costs  in august   the oregon public utility commission  opuc  authorized higher pge rates  effective october     to recover such costs  importantly  the commission order adopted a power cost adjustment mechanism that will allow the company to pass through the lion  s share of its power procurement costs to customers on a timely basis in the future  the cash recovery of power procurement costs allowed in the opuc order  combined with declining wholesale power procurement costs over the balance of this year should alleviate financial pressure at pge and facilitate improving credit measures in  
the pge ratings consider fitch  s assessment of nwn  s acquisition funding plan and the anticipated post  merger holding company structure  nwn recently announced an agreement to acquire pge from ene in a transaction valued at     billion  including the assumption of     billion of pge debt  the transaction is expected to close by the end of  and requires several regulatory approvals  including the sec  the opuc  and the washington utilities and transportation commission  as part of the transaction  nwn expects to form a new holding company  holdco   which will raise the new debt and equity required to complete the purchase of pge  post  merger  pge and nwn will operate as wholly owned first tier subsidiaries of holdco  as currently contemplated  the approximate     billion cash portion will be funded at holdco with approximately   debt and   common equity and hybrid convertible preferred stock  as a result  holdco  s consolidated and individual credit measures are expected to be relatively weak  as consolidated debt to capitalization could reach   at closing 
pge  s ultimate post  merger ratings will depend on several factors  including  the ability to gain operating synergies from its affiliation with nwn  the credit ratings fitch assigns to holdco  and the structural protections provided pge investors by state utility regulators  the current regulatory ring  fencing applied by the opuc requires pge to maintain a   common equity ratio  thereby limiting the amount of cash pge can dividend up to its parent company  it is expected that similar ring  fencing from the opuc will continue under the new holdco structure

uk  interview  u  s  dynegy still hungry for assets in europe

 c  reuters limited  
london  nov   reuters   u  s  energy group dynegy wants to buy power stations in europe as it looks to underpin an energy trading business boosted beyond recognition by its audacious takeover of stricken american rival enron 
dynegy europe  s president and chief executive officer gary cardone said his company would retain its strategy of backing wholesale energy trading with physical assets  rather than adopting enron  s  pure trading  approach to european energy markets 
 this will be an asset  backed trading business coupled with  enron  s  market  making capabilities   he told reuters in an interview on tuesday 
 our approach has been different  to enron  s    he added   they have believed in pure trading  we have believed in a very disciplined approach to assets   he added 
dynegy has agreed to buy its bigger rival enron in a   billion rescue deal 
the deal  announced last week  came after enron suffered a share  price collapse and damaging credit downgrades triggered by a regulatory probe into off  balance sheet dealings 
cardone said he considered spain  italy  the netherlands and belgium as attractive hunting grounds for assets  though he said dynegy would remain a cautious buyer 
some new entrants to europe  s liberalising energy markets had overpaid for assets in recent deals  he said 
cardone declined to comment on speculation that dynegy was a bidder for two power stations in britain  bought last month for   million by u  s  group american electric power co  
earlier this year dynegy agreed to buy the gas storage business of britain  s bg group for  million pounds    million  
no rush to sell enron assets
cardone said dynegy would not rush to dispose of enron assets in europe  which include some power generation 
 our back is not up against the wall to do a fire sale  we will look at each  enron  asset individually   he said 
enron has interests in around    megawatts of electricity generating capacity in italy  spain  poland  turkey and the uk 
on a trading level  cardone said the takeover of enron would lead to consolidation but he declined give details 
both companies have set up offices across europe in recent years as market liberalisation has triggered an increase in energy trading 
including bg  s storage operation  dynegy has a european staff of about  
enron  which has piled into european energy trading in recent years and has been a major driver of liquidity  has a european staff of around     the company is among the top gas and power traders in the uk and germany 
cardone said dynegy would operate with only one online trading platform  enron does much of its trading via its enrononline internet platform while dynegy is trying to build liquidity on its own dynegydirect system 
 our initial thoughts are that enrononline is an outstanding platform   said cardone  adding dynegy might consider selling or renting out its dynegydirect   we will only work with one portal   he said   enrononline was a great concept  although we are not convinced that we are so far behind it with dynegydirect  
he said dynegy would rebrand enrononline and all enron products   there will be nothing called enron  all trade marks will be dynegy

new york   dow jones    noah  s ark  should be the name of the company that emerges from the planned combination of enron corp   ene  and dynegy inc   dyn   according to energy markets lore these days 
after all  the logic goes  there will be two of everyone 
enron gas and electricity traders aren  t so sure of that  as job recruiting firms can attest 
 in the past  days  the number of resumes from enron personnel has increased substantially   said william begley  head of the energy and utilities practice at heidrick dynegy  s operation is staffed by  
 but with a few trimmings here and there you won  t see a lot of enron traders on the street  unless they don  t like what they hear from dynegy   said jack carr managing director of prime energy partnership  a search and recruiting company based in the uk  with an office in greenwich  connecticut 
an experienced energy trader with four years of experience can earn          plus a bonus  according to carr 
right now  enron traders are feeling disappointed and confused  according to one trader at another company who wouldn  t allow his name to be used 
 i think they  re very nervous   the trader said   the enron people think they  re better than the dynegy people  and the dynegy people think  we  re buying them  so we can just pick through their stuff

usa  ice sets record energy  metals trade volume 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
new york  nov   reuters   the intercontinental exchange  ice   an atlanta  based electronic marketplace  said on tuesday it set several new trading records last week and recorded its strongest weekly performance since it began operation  months ago 
 there has been a clear shift of energy and metal trading activity during october into ice markets   ceo jeffrey sprecher said in a statement 
sources said recent concerns over enron corp  s crumbling credit rating helped divert on  line business to ice 
trading volumes in oil and refined products set a new weekly record of  million barrels  or  million barrels per day  a  percent increase over the october daily average 
north american power volumes totaled a record  million megawatt hours  mwh  for the week  or almost  million mwh per day  a  percent gain over october activity 
north american natural gas traded  billion cubic feet  a  percent rise from october 
ice said the number of natural gas transactions was up more than  percent  indicating smaller average trade sizes 
precious metals trading for the week rose  percent from october levels  with almost  million gold  equivalent ounces trading 
as an open  access marketplace  ice has seen steady gains in liquidity over the last year  with more than  of the world  s largest commodity trading firms now participating 
the ice electronic trading system is installed on over    desktops worldwide and offers traders more than  listed commodity and derivative contract types 
products traded on ice include natural gas  power  crude oil and refined products  precious metals and emissions allowances 
contracts include physical delivery as well as financially settled swaps  spreads  differentials and options based on a variety of fixed and floating price indices 
ice was founded last year by bp  deutsche bank  goldman sachs  morgan stanley dean witter  royal dutch  shell  societe generale and totalfinaelf 
additional partners that helped launch the gas trading operation include reliant energy  aquila energy  american electric power  duke energy  el paso energy and mirant

uk  dynegy sees no problem for bg storage deal 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
london  nov   reuters   u  s  energy group dynegy said on tuesday it does not expect its planned takeover of rival american group enron to jeopardize its purchase of the natural gas storage business of britain  s bg group 
 we haven  t heard from the  uk  regulators but i can  t imagine why the acquisition of enron would change anything for  bg  storage   dynegy europe  s president and chief executive gary cardone told reuters 
dynegy  which is taking over troubled enron in a   billion rescue deal  agreed in july to buy bg storage for  million pounds    million  in cash 
but the british government in september said dynegy would have to provide assurances to address potential competition worries about the deal 
a spokesman for uk energy regulator ofgem said it was too early to say whether dynegy  s takeover of enron would influence the regulator  s view of the bg storage deal 
dynegy and enron are both significant traders on the uk spot gas market 
bg storage owns  wells with five offshore platforms  nine salt caverns  about  miles   km  of pipelines and an onshore natural gas processing terminal 
cardone said he wanted to boost bg storage  s industrial customer base to around  by the end of next year  from    currently 
  bg storage  will give us the ability to aggregate new volume and the potential for a hub to bring in new gas from norway   he said 
he said dynegy would look to expand its storage operations on the back of the bg deal   we will look at all opportunities in storage   he said 
the ability to store natural gas is becoming more of an issue as the uk  s ageing gas fields lose swing  the capacity to rapidly change output and thus smooth out demand  supply blips

cash crunch
enron has been battling a cash crunch and a loss of investor
confidence this year because of questions about partnerships it
started and put under the control of its senior executives 
  i suppose it  s important for dynegy to keep  lay  on
because of loyalty among the staff    legg mason  s whalley said 
  but after a textbook financial collapse where he obviously had
some knowledge of what was going on  this  severance package  is
pretty poor   
after the enron acquisition  watson and dynegy president and
chief operating officer stephen bergstrom will retain the top two
positions  the other two members of the office of the chairman 
which plots company strategy  will be dynegy  s doty  who will
continue as cfo  and enron  s greg whalley  as executive vice

dynegy saved enron merger with last minute pact  updatel 
 adds lehman  s izatt previously worked at moody  s  
houston  nov    bloomberg    dynegy inc  chief
executive officer charles watson got word at about    a  m 
thursday that his plan to take over enron corp   the largest
energy trader  was in danger because moody  s investors
service planned to lower enron  s credit rating to junk 
with barely an hour before moody  s was to announce the
downgrade  watson enlisted his bankers  including lehman
brothers holding inc  chief executive richard fuld  to lobby
the credit rating agency to hold off  one argument  with the
u  s  economy contracting after the sept   terrorist
attacks  the country didn  t need another bankruptcy 
the lobbying succeeded   at a price  the executives
persuaded moody  s to lower its rating one level so enron
remained an investment grade credit in exchange for six
concessions  including one which made it harder for dynegy
to walk away from the   billion acquisition  twenty  four
hours later  an agreement was reached 
  the moody  s decision was critical    watson said in
an interview    i don  t even want to think about what would
have happened to enron had it been downgraded to junk   
frances laserson  moody  s vice president of corporate
communications  declined to comment    our discussions with
clients are highly confidential    she said 
critical role
moody  s played a critical role in part because enron
was already having trouble raising money  the company had
had its rating lowered in october and a slowdown in the
economy had prompted some banks to restrict credit  a
downgrade to junk by moody  s  which rates more than  
trillion in securities  would have created a cash crisis by
forcing enron to repay early     billion of bonds and
limiting its ability to sell short  term debt 
a junk rating would have prompted dynegy to abandon the
acquisition  said watson  and cost lehman  j  p  morgan chase
 co  and salomon smith barney inc  a collective  
million in fees for advising the two companies 
in seeking to salvage the rating  the executives argued
a downgrade to junk would lead enron to file for bankruptcy
protection  they said moody  s would shoulder the blame 
according to people involved in the conversations 
on thursday morning  moody  s was willing to take that
risk  executives at the ratings company  led by chief
administration officer debra perry  told watson and his
bankers at lehman that it was about to issue a press release
cutting enron to junk 
moody  s officials said enron couldn  t keep an
investment grade rating because the company had no access to
the commercial paper market  a probe by the securities and
exchange commission into its accounting practices and a 
percent plunge in its shares had eroded investor confidence 
calling on friends
with little time to respond  watson and senior wall
street bankers swung into action  watson called his friend
david o  reilly  chief executive officer of chevrontexaco
inc   dynegy  s largest shareholder  o  reilly didn  t have
time at such short notice to push enron  s case  watson said 
next he enlisted john watson  chevrontexaco  s chief
financial officer  and darald callahan  a member of the
boards of dynegy and chevrontexaco  to call moody  s 
lehman  s ceo fuld and chief fixed  income analyst ted izatt
also pitched in  as did j  p  morgan ceo harrison and michael

watson said he and other bankers argued a combined
dynegy and enron would be a much stronger company given a
    billion cash injection from chevrontexaco  which owns
 percent of dynegy 
  to be honest  i didn  t understand why moody  s was
having difficulties making this happen    watson said 
later that day  moody  s executives told dynegy they
were prepared to keep enron at investment grade as long as
six changes were made to the proposed acquisition  according
to watson  most of the changes focused around the   material
adverse change   clause  which allowed dynegy to cancel the
deal under certain conditions 
one of those changes would have required dynegy to
eliminate a clause that allowed the company to walk away if
enron  s debt ratings were cut to junk  watson said he agreed
to the changes 
  if things got bad enough at enron that it had to be
taken to junk  there would probably be a material change in
its business that would allow us to walk away    he said

lehman  s bankers  including steve wolitzer  co  head of
mergers and acquisitions  and two colleagues  carlos fierro
and grant porter  flew to san francisco that day to
participate because they had advised chevron on the deal 
during the flight they received emails on their blackberry

that moody  s had sought

after discussing the new terms with o  reilly over tuna
steaks and filet mignon  the group agreed to reconvene at
chevron  s offices in san ramon  california at    a  m 
local time friday morning 
while the officials were deliberating  moody  s cut its
rating on enron to   baa     one level above junk  john

if you believe dynegy  s  dyn  nyse  news  commentary  account of its planned purchase of energy  trading rival enron  ene  nyse  news  commentary   it  s getting a slightly damaged mercedes for the price of a pinto 
at face value  it appears to be a fabulous deal  dynegy is acquiring a weakened  but  repairable competitor on the cheap  so what  s not to like 
the problem is  dynegy seems to be taking a rather sunny view of enron  s future  recent earnings restatements and other revelations suggest enron may actually be a junker when it comes to profitability  though enron  s disclosure practices make it impossible to know for sure  then there are indications that dynegy doesn  t expect to write down the value of enron assets by large amounts  which  if true  will certainly raise eyebrows  given the poor performance of many enron businesses 
if dynegy proves to have been optimistic in its merger math  investors may start betting against this deal  such an outcome would increase suspicions that dynegy rushed into this merger because an enron collapse would  ve cratered its business 
echoing statements from dynegy executives on a monday conference call  company spokesman steve stengel denied his company is doing the merger because it feared being damaged by an enron collapse  dynegy actually owes enron money  rather than the other way  round  he said   enron  s core business is strong  and that was a key reason dynegy undertook merger discussions with enron   stengel remarks 
both stocks rose sharply monday  enron adding  cents to     and dynegy rising      or    to      still  enron remains   below dynegy  s implied acquisition price  the stock action suggests the market is deeply divided over the deal  the deep discount on enron is a sign that the deal won  t get done  yet dynegy  s leap implies solid investor backing for the transaction and its economics  until we know more about enron  s numbers  we won  t be able to judge whether dynegy investors are right to be bullish  however 
strong indeed
among the deal  s avid supporters were a number of sell  side analysts who are longtime enron bulls  they particularly liked dynegy  s prediction that the combined entity  to be called dynegy  would post earnings   above current  estimates for stand  alone dynegy  and these bulls point out that this accretion number doesn  t include any merger synergies and it assumes enron  s  earnings are      which is   lower than analysts currently expect 
dynegy executives repeatedly stated monday that they wanted to get rid of enron  s noncore operations and keep the trading business  which has contributed the lion  s share of enron earnings  as well as pipeline assets  clearly  dynegy believes that enron  s core trading business made real profits  how much of a leap of faith is that  a considerable one  as this column has noted  enron doesn  t make it possible to break out profit margins for trading  which is included in the wholesale line in enron  s income statements 
in fact  the wholesale line includes substantial asset gains  many of which are probably one  time in nature  enron  s deals with obscure partnerships gave a huge boost to profits  according to earnings restatements made last week  don  t forget that it  s these partnership dealings that are under investigation by the securities and exchange commission  without them  and excluding one  time sales  enron  s traders may actually make very little 
marky mark
one fear was that dynegy would have to mark down enron  s underperforming assets by billions of dollars  charges erode equity  lower equity would possibly mean a higher debt  to  capital ratio  calculated by taking debt as a percentage of total capital  or debt plus equity   if this ratio gets above   to    rating agencies might consider downgrading dynegy  which could deter counterparties from trading with it  but dynegy expects the debt  to  capital ratio to be about   in the merged institution 
somewhat implausibly  dynegy  s forecasts don  t appear to factor in big markdowns in enron equity  in the third quarter of next year  enron  s equity is expected to be     billion  that  s only slightly below what it probably was at the end of this year  s third quarter  enron still hasn  t released a third  quarter balance sheet   how can it not decrease over the next  months 
a person familiar with the matter says that dynegy also expects to mark up enron assets at the time of the deal  s closing  these markups are expected to at least partially offset any markdowns  this person adds  but it  s tough to identify any enron assets that could qualify for hefty positive adjustments  while it  s easier to point out assets that deserve negative ones  dynegy needs to break out markups and markdowns and reveal which assets are being subject to the adjustments 
dynegy  s stengel didn  t comment on the question of equity writedowns 
by stretching too far in its assumptions  dynegy may be trying to dress up a risky merger as a safe one  but a risky merger may  in dynegy  s view  have been preferable to having enron go down  again and again monday  dynegy execs said they  ve done their due diligence and they believe that there aren  t any huge skeletons in enron  s closet that could upset the merger 
but contrast this stance with that of standard  poor  s analysts  who said friday that they would  ve downgraded enron  s debt to junk status if dynegy hadn  t agreed to buy enron  one of the s  p analysts said friday that they didn  t have a full understanding of all the partnerships that enron has been dealing with  if s  p  which  like other rating agencies  has been locked in deep and detailed discussions with enron for weeks  doesn  t know the effect of all the partnerships  how can dynegy 
 dynegy has been doing business with enron for  years  we know them and they know us   stengel replies   we are comfortable with the due diligence we have conducted thus far and will continue to look at enron and their operations in the coming weeks and months  
until dynegy comes up with more details  assume enron is a pinto 
dynegy asked ferc to revise regs

houston  cbs  mw    long before enron and its northern natural gas pipeline entered the picture  dynegy complained to the federal energy regulatory commission about companies with pipeline systems crowding out competitors from the natural gas transmission market 
in a filing dated jan      dynegy  dyn  asked to speak in front of the ferc about what it characterized as  affiliate abuse and structural preferences   which are  alive and growing in the gas industry  
now  even if dynegy  s   billion takeover of enron fails  the power generator can keep the energy trader  s northern natural gas pipeline  according to the merger agreement 
 they  re kind of complaining about themselves now   said raymond plank  chairman and chief executive of natural gas and oil producer houston  based apache corp   apa   in an interview 
northern natural is enron  s  ene  largest transmission system with    miles of pipeline 
 our position has not changed   dynegy spokesman steve stengel said in an e  mail to cbs  marketwatch  com   we do not believe that companies should be able to  abuse  their power within a market and we also believe that regulators need to continue to monitor markets to ensure market abuse does not occur  
in a subsequent e  mail  stengel said  we are going to comply fully with ferc regulations   the answer was in response to a question about how dynegy plans to guard against abuse once it owns a pipeline system 
in the executive summary dynegy filed to the ferc  the company claimed that structural affiliate preference  is a far greater threat to market participants in coming years  
dynegy contended that a pipeline or transmission company affiliate  can always pay more  or withstand greater risk from  services purchased from home pipelines because of the benefits inuring to the parent holding company   dynegy also alleged that because affiliates control the pipelines  they crowd out competitors 
one concern dynegy listed is the  vertical overlapping  of gas pipeline companies and utilities  dynegy owns the electric and gas utility illinois power 
in its comments  dynegy advocated structural changes to the affiliate relationship in order to prevent abuse of the system and eliminate the preference problem  dynegy also recommended that if  rampant  abuse is found  the company should be required to divest the non  regulated affiliate  
on sept    the ferc issued a statement proposing a set of uniformly applied regulations to oversee the relationship between regulated transmission providers and their energy affiliates 
citing the sweeping changes in both the gas and electricity markets  the ferc said that current rules  fail to address the sharing of confidential shipper information and transportation information with all energy affiliates  
the ferc proposed that the employees of transmission providers involved in the operation of transmission systems function apart from the providers  sales or marketing employees and energy affiliates 
 in addition  the prohibition on preferential sharing of transmission information would be broadened to include all energy affiliates   the ferc stated 
apache  s plank said his company is in the process of figuring out how best to help  apache wants to take the volatility out of the energy market  and he pegs dynegy and enron as major contributors to the situation 
 the government says they believe in transparency  but they believe it applies to everyone  else    he said   if they let us know what they  re looking for  we could be very helpful in the interest of the u  s  
shares of dynegy added  cents to     in tuesday trading  while enron advanced by  cents to
