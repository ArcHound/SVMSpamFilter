steve lacey    an emergency  repair dispatcher for a utility company in salem  ore   has a personal life that reads like a holiday greeting card  he recently married his longtime love  and after packing boxes over thanksgiving weekend  they are set to move into their dream house in the country  just in time for christmas  lacey  s retirement plans  however  are in ruins  he works for the embattled energy  trading firm enron  and has all his   k  savings in enron stock  which plunged from   a share in late  to     at the end of last week 
much of that decline has come since october when enron reported it had lost   million in the third quarter and later admitted it had overstated earnings from  to   as their life savings shriveled  all lacey and his co  workers could do was watch  from oct   to mid  november  enron blocked its employees from shifting investments in their   k  accounts  while it switched to a new plan administrator 
lacey has joined a federal lawsuit that accuses enron of breaching its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in enron stock even after executives became aware of serious financial problems that would hurt the stock price   there was a lot of promotion inside the company to invest in enron and help us grow  so everybody got into it   lacey told time  s cathy booth thomas  enron says it doesn  t comment on pending lawsuits 
lacey and his colleagues could not have anticipated that they would be stuck with a plummeting stock  but their woes should be seen as a warning not to hold too much of your employer  s stock in your   k  and to regularly monitor the diversification of your investments 
like enron  s  many firms    k  plans can have blackout periods lasting from a few days to a few weeks when they change plan administrators   that  s not necessarily wrong or illegal   says alden bianchi  chairman of the employee  benefits group at the mirick o  connell law firm in westborough  mass  employees need to make sure their   k  investments are diversified at all times   in case they can  t shift them for a while 
like enron  many other big firms match employee contributions with company stock  your allocation to that one investment can grow very quickly  and you might not be allowed to reallocate those matching funds into other investments until age  to   at the end of last year  a whopping   of total assets in profit sharing and   k  plans were invested in the stock of the sponsoring company  among employees who are allowed to hold their employer  s stock in their   k  account    invested half or more of their savings in that stock 
financial planners will tell you it  s a mistake to bet so much on a single stock   especially that of the company you work for  whose fortunes already affect your job security and career advancement  planners often advise investors to hold as little of their employer  s stock as they can   say  only the amount the company gives them as a matching contribution  then they should shift assets out of even that matching stock into a mix of diversified stock  and  bond mutual funds as soon as they are old enough to do so  similarly  if your employer gives you options to buy company stock  don  t buy and hold the stock  cash it in and invest the proceeds in a diverse blend of stocks and bonds or mutual funds 
remember that it  s your responsibility to arrange your investments so that they can survive any financial trouble your employer might suffer  as financial planner clare wherley of new providence  n  j   says   it  s not the company  s responsibility to make sure your investments go up

enron  dynegy work to salvage merger deal

top executives of enron corp  and dynegy inc  raced to salvage a deal to combine the two energy  trading companies amid growing signs that enron is facing cash  flow problems as a result of a sharp downturn in its core trading business 
the executives  task gained urgency amid worries that enron  s debt may soon be downgraded to junk status by leading credit  rating agencies  after holding talks with executives of enron and dynegy  representatives of moody  s investors service inc   standard  poor  s ratings group and fitch inc  agreed to hold off on making any ratings move yesterday  people familiar with the discussions said  j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup inc   s citibank  which are shepherding the merger and have already loaned   billion and agreed to invest an additional   million in the merged company  may arrange still more funding for enron  these people said 
 i hope they err on the conservative side and stockpile cash   said ralph pellecchia  analyst for fitch  the credit  rating agency 
with few viable options remaining  enron  s board late yesterday informally agreed to a new share  exchange ratio of    shares of dynegy for each enron share tendered  down more than   from the original offer of    dynegy share for each enron share  according to one person familiar with the situation  but the talks were still fluid as of late yesterday 
the latest proposed share  exchange ratio values enron at     a share  or a total of     billion  this would compare with the original value of     a share  or     billion  in exchange for reducing the purchase price  some members of the enron team were insisting on more control over the merged company  dynegy also was considering an additional   million cash investment in enron  dynegy  together with chevrontexaco inc   has already injected     billion into enron in an effort to stabilize the company 
talks between enron and dynegy were said to be tense and occasionally acrimonious 
at  p  m   enron shares were up  cents to      while dynegy shares were up     to      in new york stock exchange composite trading 
talks between enron and dynegy began in earnest over the weekend to cut the price of the all  stock transaction after enron  s share price had plummeted in the wake of disclosures that its future earnings wouldn  t be as high as originally anticipated  on nov    dynegy originally agreed to buy enron after the emergence of damaging revelations concerning a series of deals that allowed enron executives to profit personally at the expense of the company and its shareholders  those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation 
while struggling to keep the planned merger alive  enron also has been seeking to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings  enron has a total of about   billion of debt  of which about   billion comes due by the end of next year  the company may find itself on the hook for an additional   billion in off  balance  sheet debt and another     billion in potential liabilities  related to troubled investment partnerships  if its credit rating drops to below investment grade  says mr  pellecchia  the fitch analyst  a cut to a junk  status credit rating could deal a fatal blow to enron  which needs huge sums of cheap money to keep its trading operations alive 
enron  nowadays  seems to be generating less cash from that business  which accounted for more than   of its profit in the most recent quarter  in the five weeks since enron  s problems became widely known  its trading partners have sought to protect themselves by shifting deals elsewhere from the dominant enrononline trading exchange and to limit their exposure to the houston  based company  about a week ago  enron said it had about     billion in cash  which surprised analysts who expected a number at least   billion higher given the most recent infusions from dynegy and the banks 
enron spokeswoman karen denne said the company  is continuing to meet all our obligations   she added that trading activity at the enrononline unit had been  below average  in recent days  but that the company believes  it has stabilized  
analysts say cash on hand doesn  t appear to be enough to keep enron alive for long  given the reluctance of its trading partners and creditors  rebecca followill  an analyst at howard weil in houston  says that enron needs a bigger cash hoard than ever to rebuild confidence  she reckons enron needs   billion to   billion on hand while the merger deal winds its way through shareholder and regulatory approvals

deals  deal makers  banks  too  have stake in enron merger    stature  money are both on the line

as important as completing the enron corp   dynegy inc  merger is for the two companies  it is almost as critical for the banks that have backed it 
j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup inc  have emerged as prominent financiers and cheerleaders behind the problem  plagued transaction  putting hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money into enron in hopes of keeping the deal alive  late yesterday  that effort continued  with the banks scrambling for new terms to avoid a credit downgrade that could scuttle the deal 
but in addition to putting their money behind the proposed merger  the two lending giants have also staked their reputations   and perhaps even some of their prowess in the mergers  and  acquisitions business itself   on completing this transaction 
both j  p  morgan and citigroup officials have said privately that the pending deal is a bellwether  that is because it could illustrate how big banking institutions can use their lending muscle to offer customers one  stop shopping  thus usurping business from the other  more  traditional investment  banking institutions 
because the banks offered financing to enron on short  notice to grab the advisory business  the deal has the  potential for either giving a boost to a bank  s stature on the street or to sling some mud in its face   said samuel hayes  professor of finance at harvard business school   this is a high  stakes assignment  
and an expensive one  if the deal doesn  t happen  each bank has commitments outstanding to enron  in the form of various loans  of roughly   million to   million  according to officials familiar with the matter  and roughly half of that is in unsecured debt  the two companies  these officials say  have also committed an additional equity investment of   million each so far  though there is a possibility enron could get more 
as mergers go  the deal is relatively small  and it has gotten smaller in recent days as investors have hammered lower enron  s stock  which at  p  m  yesterday stood at      up  cents in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
but on wall street  the importance of the deal goes well beyond its size  where the transaction is seen as a high  profile example of the new era of finance in which large financials exploit the crumbling walls between once  separate businesses like lending  underwriting and mergers advisory 
goldman sachs group  an investment bank that doesn  t traditionally extend large loans to clients  was denied a piece of the merger business because it declined to extend the sort of loans that j  p  morgan and citigroup provided last week 
should this deal fall through  it will make goldman look smart   there is a lot more to this deal for the banks than just  mergers and advisory  fees   says andy collins  an analyst at u  s  bancorp piper jaffray 
it is also seen as well as a major test of the decision in  to repeal depression  era laws under the gramm  leach bliley act 
for decades  the u  s  financial system effectively banned commercial banks from lending to the same clients they served as an investment bank  the thinking was that commercial banks  the federally insured guardians of deposits  shouldn  t be betting in the securities markets with depositor money 
now with those laws repealed  some worry about risks creeping back into the system  roy smith  a business professor at new york university  says the banks  lending to the same clients from which they seek to win securities business could encourage banks to over  lend for the purpose of closing deals 
 you can  t believe the chairman of the bank is up at night thinking about this   says mr  smith 
the banks  while conceding some exposure to enron  decline to confirm specific amounts  citing client confidentiality  but in private conversations  banks say they regularly sell loans to companies in which they may be too exposed in an active secondary market  moreover  they use other credit derivatives to effectively transfer the risk of loans to other investors 
some of the recent documentation of enron debt suggests that much of the debt has been diversified across many investors  in may   for example  citigroup and j  p  morgan arranged a large     billion credit facility for enron  part of the total of approximately   billion in debt on enron  s balance sheet  not including commitments to other financial institutions  
those two banks  as lead arrangers of that financing  helped divide that loan up among  different banks  according to loan pricing corp   a research institute the follows the lending business  many of those banks divided their shares into even smaller pieces and sold them off to other investors  one banker familiar with the matter said that  all told  more than  financial institutions have exposure to enron 
yet j  p  morgan and citigroup  who have served as the top underwriters of this debt  would rather avoid being blamed for letting enron  s debts go bad  even more importantly  they also hold their own portion of that debt  thus  both banks recently provided an additional credit line to enron totaling   billion 
that additional lending  while enhancing the value of existing loans to enron  is also relatively safe because it is secured with hard assets  should enron default  the banks would take an interest in that collateral   that additional credit line is bullet proof   says one banker 
the banks  ultimately  have had a string of successes with similar strategies with other firms  though few are as high  profile as enron  these two banks  for example  are credited with saving companies like lucent technologies from a financial crisis earlier this year with a similar combination of financing and investment banking advise  but speaking privately  bankers concede that a failure of the enron deal would smart beyond what the damage might be to the banks  loan portfolio 
 if it falls apart   says mr  hayes  the harvard professor   it will be a source of embarrassment

enron corp   s precarious financial condition has unnerved investors and trading partners  but the largely invisible natural  gas and electricity trading industry that it helped build appears relatively resilient   at least so far 
veteran traders say many firms began to take precautionary steps a month ago against an energy  market meltdown related to enron  when the first tidbits of the houston  based company  s woes were reported  trading volume has moved from the popular enrononline electronic platform to other venues  some traders have unwound complex financial bets  and others have simply worked around their onetime trading partner 
as a result  insiders say natural  gas prices  in particular  haven  t really been affected so far by enron  s problems  and any impact is expected to be moderate 
unlike a traditional commodities exchange  open to all  natural gas and electricity are traded privately  with many transactions reflecting deals between two players  enrononline  for instance  acts as both the buyer and seller  setting the price for which it will buy or sell commodities such as natural gas or electricity  players such as enron  which had transformed itself from a natural  gas pipeline company  make money by buying and selling energy many times over  capturing the difference between bids from buyers and offers from sellers  but actual trading strategies are tightly kept secrets  which has made the business difficult to track and assess 
while the energy market has held up amid enron  s woes  it remains edgy  especially given the uncertainty about what might happen if dynegy inc   s agreement to acquire enron is aborted   companies have stopped doing business with enron to the best of their ability   says art gelber  principal of gelber gas closed at     a million british thermal units in new york mercantile exchange trading yesterday 
even in a worst  case scenario  however  most traders assume that whoever takes control of the company  s assets will probably handle delivery of commodities against its contracts  he says 
 enron has caused some short  term price moves  but it  s not a big part of what the market is going to do in the long run   says bill o  neill  director of commodity research at merrill lynch  co   you have to remember that the fundamentals for energy  particularly demand  are not too good right now  because of the economy  
indeed  natural  gas storage is nearly full  and so far  warm fall weather hasn  t helped demand any   a growing inventory of natural gas should have a moderating effect on any transitional difficulties that might arise because of a continued downward path for enron   says jon rasmussen  an economist at the department of energy  s energy information administration 
one clear impact has been on enrononline  enron  s electronic trading arm that had become the dominant energy e  trading platform in recent years  accounting for as much as   of the country  s natural  gas and electricity deliveries  the rival inc  has reported a   jump in its weekly electricity volume since october    in natural gas  and a   increase in crude oil  the atlanta  based concern is owned by about  energy and metals traders  brokers and banks 
other traders have returned to doing trades over the phone  a less transparent method than pulling prices off a screen   this is doing a lot to re  establish human contact   says one trading executive

back in the mid   s  a pipeline executive called ken lay was fishing around for a name for his company  produced by a merger of houston natural gas and omaha  based internorth  he consulted with consultants  politicked with politicians  and came up with a moniker  the company would be called  enteron  
three weeks later  fed up with the wisecracks from a press that had looked up the dictionary definition of  enteron   n  the intestine   he changed the company  s name again  henceforth it would be known as enron 
a columnist less devoted to high standards of decorum might be tempted to extend the metaphor of the company  s misbegotten name  in recent weeks  after all  we  ve seen enron  s stock collapse over indigestible accounting and the emergence of dealings between the company and its senior officers that exude an odor of genuine malfeasance  the evidence is far from clear  but for the sake of mr  lay  s reputation one hopes these missteps will prove one more case of a company fooling itself rather than setting out deliberately to defraud the markets 
enron grew to be much more than a pipeline hauler of natural gas  becoming the pre  eminent trader and marketer of all kinds of energy contracts and a vocal proponent of deregulation  now  all but overnight  it  s kaput  just waiting to find out if its fate will be bankruptcy or absorption by an erstwhile rival 
we cannot help be put in mind of another commodity wunderkind in the  s  phibro  short for philipp brothers   hard to believe  but phibro was once a name that made grown men quiver on wall street  fattened by trading profits from the great commodity inflation of the  s  which some mistook for a permanent new age of scarcity  it scooped up the street  s oldest partnership  salomon brothers  tucking it into its back pocket and renaming the combined firm phibro  salomon  here was a powerhouse of unlimited potential  investors told themselves 
flash ahead to california  s electricity meltdown earlier this year  enron saw its revenues quadruple partly as a result of the inflated prices being quoted in the california market  many foresaw a new scarcity megatrend  but there was no true energy shortage  posted prices on the california power exchange may have skyrocketed  but the effective price was zero dollars and zero cents  because the utilities had no cash to pay and politicians were thumbing their noses at piles of ious 
when prices are zero  suppliers take a hike   that  s what economics teaches  but once the state government started pumping its own cash into the market  the phony posted prices plummeted and supplies became plentiful again  now california is swimming in power and nobody talks about an  energy crisis  anymore 
you can date the loss of investor confidence in enron almost exactly to the moment when the california fiasco began to repair itself  fortune magazine put the inaugural nail in enron  s coffin in march  noting that the company  s growing dependence on trading had turned it into an oil  patch version of goldman sachs  goldman  s stock sells at a price  earnings multiple of   reflecting investors  well  founded distrust of trading earnings to be reproduced reliably year after year  so why  the magazine asked  was enron awarded a multiple of   plus  mmm   
enron did yeoman service as a champion of deregulation  boss ken lay  a believer in technology and the power of markets  was a true visionary  to the point of annoying people who didn  t care for his air of being a man on the right side of history  the moldering pipeline he took over would certainly have been an also  ran if he had not thrown enron headlong into trading and marketing 
but deregulation doesn  t confer permanent advantage on anybody  a deregulated environment favors constant innovation and a continual upsetting of plans and strategies 
add the fact that  despite the california bubble  there is no reason to believe energy prices won  t continue their long  term relative decline as technology advances more quickly than the depletion of conventional resources  add also the likelihood that information technology will continue to lower the barriers to entry to enron  s trading business  which means more competition and shrinking margins  enron begins to look a lot like phibro 
the great commodity  trading machine was already running down by   when it bought salomon and wall street was swooning  inflation was being quelled by paul volcker  the products that phibro traders bought and sold were increasingly being traded transparently on electronic exchanges   four or five years ago  they used to be able to take other companies to the cleaners  because they knew where the market was and others didn  t   a trader explained   with everyone knowing  within a few cents  where the price of any product was  phibro  s ability to make a profit off its superior knowledge disappeared  
not only is this true of enron  but of its would  be bottom fisher  dynegy  run by mr  lay  s houston homeboy  chuck watson  dynegy  s proposed takeover of its former nemesis was hanging by a negotiation yesterday 
while enron in recent years was selling hard assets and concentrating on electronic market  making  mr  watson was doing the opposite  his big play in the enron deal is to get his hands on the original hng  internorth pipeline  now known as northern natural gas  by having both feet planted in the real business  he claims his firm will be able to make a profitable sideline out of trading despite growing competition and transparency 
we  ll see  dynegy and enron were born at the same time  and of the same motive  dynegy was originally created by six pipeline companies  a washington law firm and morgan stanley to take advantage of new opportunities in deregulated natural gas  but the gnats are already circling 
gas producers who have claimed for years that the duo control too much of their fate now insist they shouldn  t be allowed to merge  don  t listen to the fussbudgets  if this was a business in need of trustbusting  enron wouldn  t have been resorting to funny accounting to make its earnings  as merrill lynch  s donato eassey has pointed out  wholesale margins have been steadily thinning as trading becomes more transparent and competitive 
wishful accounting has time and again proved the last refuge of companies whose dearly held  visions  were not panning out  enron prided itself on being realistic and adaptive  but it failed to see that its own beliefs about the world needed overhauling

trying to restore confidence in enron to salvage a merger
by richard a  oppel jr  and andrew ross sorkin
    
the new york times
page   column 
c   new york times company
the enron corporation and dynegy inc  worked yesterday to find ways to bolster confidence in enron  s weakened energy  trading business as the companies  negotiators continued talks on revising the terms of their merger  executives close to the talks said 
the renegotiated deal would cut the value of the acquisition by half  they said  to roughly   billion  dynegy  they said  was also prepared to invest at least an additional   million in enron  on top of the     billion cash infusion from dynegy  s biggest investor  chevrontexaco  included in the initial deal announced nov    but dynegy wants the new cash backed by hard assets  and the companies were trying to identify and value enough enron holdings not already mortgaged to other creditors  the executives said 
before a series of financial disclosures sent enron  s stock into collapse and the company into the arms of dynegy  its houston rival  enron  s natural gas and electricity trading floors did more business than the two largest competitors combined  they also accounted for the majority of enron  s profits by far 
but traders and wall street analysts said the business had steadily deteriorated amid questions about the depths of enron  s financial straits  many traders have curtailed dealings with enron  and the executives close to the talks said dynegy officials scouring enron  s books were having difficulty this week figuring out how much cash the trading operation was generating 
the executives close to the talks said that the renegotiated terms for dynegy  s acquisition of enron would lower the price to about    dynegy share for each share of enron  cutting by half the value of the deal announced nov    when dynegy offered    share  if a deal is struck at    dynegy share  at yesterday  s closing prices  dynegy would be paying about     an enron share  a    percent premium over enron  s diminished stock price  the premium was    percent over enron  s closing price on the day that the deal was announced 
both companies are seeking promises from enron  s bank lenders to extend debt repayment dates until after the merger closes  and they are also discussing adding provisions that could limit dynegy  s ability to back out of the combination 
the two companies are also working to arrange a cash infusion of   million from j  p  morgan chase and citigroup that would provide enron with desperately needed new cash 
but there is growing concern that the cash infusion from the banks will not calm investors  fears or reassure energy traders  leading dynegy to seek an additional   million in cash for enron  late yesterday  the two companies were hung up over whether enron  which has already used many of its most prized assets as collateral for loans  has enough assets left to serve as collateral for the additional money  according to executives close to the talks 
a number of enron assets were being examined  including some that have already been used to obtain other loans  the executives said  the assets include  transwestern pipeline  a major natural gas pipeline that links the gas  producing basins of texas and the southwest with california  enron  s stake in other gas  pipeline assets  its    percent stake  worth about   million  in eog resources  a former subsidiary that is now an independent publicly traded oil and gas company  and its indirect stake in hanover compressor  which manufactures equipment used to increase the pressure of natural gas and facilitate its flow on interstate pipelines 
yesterday  investors anxiously awaited a report by moody  s investors service  which like other major credit  rating firms  currently ranks enron  s debt at the lowest investment  grade level  if enron were to lose its investment  grade status  it could be forced to repay or refinance up to     billion in debt  while other traders would probably further curtail business  but by late yesterday  moody  s decided not to issue a statement after receiving assurances from enron and dynegy officials that a renegotiated deal would be announced soon  the executives said  a moody  s spokesman declined comment 
executives close to the talks said that they hoped that new cash from dynegy would reassure both wall street and the energy  trading markets that enron  s trading floor would survive and remain a valuable asset 
but analysts and investors are having difficulty figuring how much value the trading operation has already lost  and how much the business has been reduced because of credit concerns 
  i believe dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration in the core business and wants to renegotiate the purchase price as a result    said andre meade  head of united states utilities research for commerzbank securities in new york    i don  t think anyone can estimate the earning power of enron over the next three to four quarters  and i  m not sure enron has a good estimate   
mr  meade said he did not believe that dynegy  s earlier estimate that the acquisition would add  cents a share to its earnings was   reliable today  given how sharply the business seems to have deteriorated    by mr  meade  s calculations  if enron  s trading volumes were to fall  percent next year   even if normal volume growth levels returned in    that would wipe out nearly all the value in the stock 
karen denne  an enron spokeswoman  said the company had experienced a decline in energy trading volume and in the number of traders doing business with it  but both stabilized yesterday  she declined to elaborate or quantify the decline 
she also said that enron  s trading operation remained profitable  though she could not quantify it  and she also said she did not know whether the company was working on a possible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plans should its business and liquidity worsen    we  re moving forward with the merger    she said 
dynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterday 
shares of enron rose yesterday on news of a possible revised acquisition agreement  they closed at      up    percent  or  cents  shares of dynegy closed at      up    percent  or     
though yesterday  s gains halted a four  day slide in enron shares  the stock is down  percent this year after disclosures of major losses as well as significant accounting errors that led enron to admit it overstated profits during the last five years by nearly   million 
now  difficulties within enron  s trading operation are exacerbating the company  s overall liquidity problems in three ways  according to some analysts and rival energy  trading executives 
first  other traders are requiring enron to put up greater margin on its trades  on top of that  in some cases enron  s traders are being forced to pay more to buy natural gas than traders at other companies  this credit premium in some transactions has ranged from  cents to  cents for every million british thermal units of gas enron buys  these people say 
additionally  many traders  like the mirant corporation  have either scaled back or stopped doing business with enron  hurting its trading revenue 
mr  meade of commerzbank said   end  use customers and trading counterparties appear to be shifting their business to competitors as a result of enron  s credit concerns and are reluctant to increase their exposures to enron

enron  dynegy pursue the right price
by laura goldberg
copyright  houston chronicle
dynegy and enron corp  continued discussions tuesday on several issues  including new terms for dynegy  s deal to buy enron and an equity infusion for enron  according to people familiar with the talks 
there was no sense talks were breaking down  but instead there were a lot of pieces that needed to be put in place  the people said 
sources told the chronicle on monday that the two houston  based energy traders were negotiating a lower exchange rate for dynegy  s stock deal to buy enron 
the sources also said enron and dynegy were working with a group of banks to reach a so  called  override  agreement to extend  until after the merger closes  maturity dates for certain enron debt  and that the two energy companies were working to finalize terms for equity infusion into enron of around   million  expected to come from j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup 
dynegy  one source said tuesday  could also be a contributor to that   million 
under the nov   deal  enron shareholders would receive    share of dynegy stock per enron share owned  since then  there have been increasing worries about enron  s core trading business and new troubling financial disclosures from enron 
the sources said tuesday the new ratio being discussed is around    
dynegy spokesman john sousa said tuesday he could confirm only that dynegy was in discussions with parties involved in transactions related to the deal 
investors appeared optimistic tuesday that dynegy and enron would work out an arrangement to save the merger  shares in dynegy closed up     at      while shares in enron closed up  cents at     
wall street expects dynegy to either cut its purchase price or walk away  that dynegy is negotiating a lower exchange ratio shows it is very intent on keeping the deal together  said jeff dietert  an analyst with simmons  co  international in houston 
if the deal falls apart  enron would likely see its credit rating cut to so  called junk status  which would trigger a series of negative consequences  among them  enron  s ability to run its trading business would be severely hampered  in turn  enron could quickly be forced into bankruptcy 
enron  s trading operation  which is highly dependent upon access to cash and credit  is already suffering  enron hopes another equity infusion will spur other traders to return the business they  ve taken elsewhere 
 it appears that trading counterparties have moved significant volumes away from enron over the past few weeks as a result of credit concerns   andre meade  an analyst at commerzbank securities in new york  wrote in a report tuesday morning 
that new deal terms are being discussed  confirms our fears that enron  s core trading and marketing business has been rapidly deteriorating and is worth much less today than several weeks ago   meade said 
tuesday afternoon  word spread among analysts and investors that moody  s investors service would issue a rating report on enron before day  s end  they were waiting to see if moody  s would have soothing words on enron or drop its credit rating to junk  but no report was released 
enron is expected to lay off employees this week

cooperation from enron key in probe
by tom fowler
copyright  houston chronicle
federal officials say they are willing to be more lenient with companies that cooperate in securities fraud cases  an attitude that could help get enron corp  off the hook in its current sec investigation 
but it could also put individual executives   including its former chief financial officer and other former employees   in the hot seat 
in the months since he took over as head of the securities and exchange commission  chairman harvey pitt has laid out policies that will give companies credit for coming forward to report misconduct such as improper accounting  the message has been that cooperation could spare companies harsher penalties 
the sec is so serious about its new attitude that late last month it took the highly unusual step of outlining the reasons it decided not to bring an enforcement action against seaboard corp  of shawnee mission  kan 
the pork processing and cargo shipping company issued misstatements in its annual and quarterly reports from december  to march  based on improper entries booked by a controller at a florida division 
in a statement  the sec said the company  s conduct was key to it avoiding the enforcement action because within a week of finding the alleged misconduct  internal auditors did a preliminary review and advised management and its board of directors  who then hired an outside law firm to do an independent review 
four days later the controller who covered up the problems was fired  along with two supervisors  and the public was notified of the problem  the sec reached a settlement directly with the former controller  where she agreed not to violate securities laws in the future 
while the seaboard case is the only enforcement action to occur since the new policies were put in place  observers say it  s likely they could be applied to enron in the sec investigation 
 you won  t see the sec be easy on anyone   said frank velie  a former u  s  attorney and partner with new york  based salans hertzfeld heilbronn christy  viener   but if you have an individual  or a small group of individuals who acted illegally  and the company acts swiftly to fire them  turn over information to the sec and cooperate  in many cases the company can escape prosecution  
since sec officials began looking into a number of off  balance  sheet partnerships formed by enron  s former cfo  andrew fastow  the company has gone to great lengths to appear cooperative and to distance itself from anyone associated with the partnerships 
the day after an earnings report last month revealed enron would lose   million and take a   billion hit on shareholder equity because of the complex financing partnerships  enron chairman and chief executive officer ken lay and the company  s board of directors said they stood by fastow  the board had approved all the partnerships and dealings  it was noted 
a week later  however  on oct    the company replaced fastow 
on oct    the day enron said the sec had upgraded its review of the finances from a simple inquiry to a formal investigation  the company announced it  s board of directors had created an investigation committee of its own with the power to take disciplinary action against any enron employee  officer or director who it determined     improperly participated in the transactions  
the committee took action shortly after  as several employees were fired for their involvement in the deals  a spokesman said  including ben glisan  a managing director and treasurer of enron corp   and kristina mordaunt  a managing director and general counsel of an enron division  other employees who were determined to have invested in the partnerships  including fastow and executives michael kopper  kathy lynn and anne yeager  no longer work for enron 
in its sec filing that outlined more details of the partnerships earlier this month  enron again tried to distance itself from the deals by saying that it was aware of the partnerships but required that certain safeguards be put in place and that the transactions be approved and reviewed regularly 
painting the company as a relative innocent that fell victim to the dealings of renegade employees may make sense in the face of the sec inquiry  but it won  t ensure safe passage for enron  says henry hu  a law professor at the university of texas in austin

enron shares accounted for  percent of the savings plan  s

anyone who wanted to gauge how this approach  and enron  s

between october  and november   enron  locked down  the retirement plan  barring employees from selling their shares  from the market  s close on october  to november   enron shares lost  per cent of their value  eli gottesdiener  gottesdiener  s principal  said that his claim of   m was based on the drop in the value of the company stock in the pension fund from     bn at the start of the year to about   m today 
enron shares accounted for about  per cent of the     bn plan  s assets at the end of   according to another of the lawsuits  filed by the law firm campbell harrison last week 
that amount was far too high for prudent diversification of investment  mr gottesdiener said  this was in addition to his objection to enron  s  lockdown   which forced employees to watch as their retirement savings plunged while the fund underwent administrative changes   we allege a breach of fiduciary duty under the circumstances   he said   knowing that people would want to sell their stock  and realising that enron was not the company they thought it was  under those circumstances  to lock people in  was grossly negligent and a violation of enron  s duty  
the lawsuits raise several issues  such as a company  s fiduciary duty in offering its own shares to employees in a retirement plan  and its right to ban employees from selling shares 
defined contribution plans such as enron  s  in which employees allocate their retirement money from a menu of choices including mutual funds and company stock  are regulated by the labor department  they are not overseen by the securities and exchange commission  which oversees traditional mutual funds 
no regulation limits companies  ability to start such  lockdowns   beyond basic fiduciary duty  as a result  there is little day  to  day oversight of the management of the investments  said geoff bobroff  a former sec attorney and financial services industry consultant 
an older type of employee retirement plan  a defined benefit plan  has a  per cent limit on the amount of company stock that can be held in the pension fund because these plans are administered entirely by the company  but the legislation does not extend to defined contribution plans  mr gottesdiener said part of the reason he was bringing the lawsuit was to push for legislation to place the same  per cent cap on company stock in defined contribution plans that exists for defined benefit plans 
he added that when a company matched the employee contribution with its own stock alone  it pushed employees to buy more company stock  forsaking prudent diversification   as long as companies match their employees  contributions in their own stock  people take that as implicit investment advice  
enron  s only matching contributions were in company stock

enron was yesterday locked in negotiations with dynegy  its energy trading rival  about reworking the details of dynegy  s rescue bid 
dynegy is understood to be considering halving the value of the all  stock bid in the light of enron  s deepening financial crisis 
john sousa  spokesman for dynegy  said   i can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal  
dynegy  s bid  launched on november   is worth   a share  or     bn  but the enron shares were trading yesterday morning at     
enron  s fate still depends on dynegy  s commitment to the deal  lenders  willingness to restructure their loans  and credit ratings agencies  decision not to downgrade enron debt to junk status 
a downgrade by the large rating agencies would trigger a series of collateral calls by trading counterparties  it would also oblige enron to repay about     bn of bonds  karen denne  enron spokeswoman  said   we  re still working on an equity infusion of   m to   bn  and we  re still working on restructuring our debt  
the most likely investors are jp morgan chase and citigroup  which have already extended a   bn secured credit line to enron and are the energy group  s principal advisers on the dynegy deal 
 you have five moving parts  dynegy  chevron  texaco  which owns  per cent of dynegy   enron  citigroup and chase  all these people are horse trading   said john olson  of sanders morris harris  a houston  based investment banking and securities firm 
people close to the negotiations said enron was seeking further guarantees from dynegy that it would not pull out of the deal  enron is also seeking further cash on top of the     bn dynegy has already committed with the backing of chevrontexaco 
andre meade  an analyst with commerzbank securities  said that even if the deal were completed  the underlying earnings associated with enron  s trading and marketing business may be significantly lower than dynegy anticipates   creditsights  a credit research group  said the mounting shareholder and employee litigation against enron risked triggering a clause that allows dynegy to walk away if potential liabilities exceed     bn

enron  the houston energy company that helped throw california into crisis last year  spirals downward  its stock has fallen from a high of near   to   tuesday  a planned rescue  merger is being renegotiated  and enron  s executives are disgraced 
the only shame in this is that    enron employees have seen their retirement accounts tank right along with the company stock  we can only wish them luck in their lawsuit filed this week against the company  which urged them right up until the stock crashed to keep buying enron  then froze the retirement fund so employees couldn  t sell their stock while the price skidded  the freeze was billed as an administrative necessity while plan managers were being changed 
considering that enron chairman kenneth l  lay made about   million on his stock options in  and the first few months of  alone  maybe he  ll volunteer to cover some of the   million in retirement plan losses  fat chance  ditto the nearly   million that former enron president jeffrey k  skilling cleared on his options in   it was skilling  s august resignation that helped trigger enron  s decline   that and disclosures that its executives had formed off  the  books partnerships that essentially concealed company debt 
enron  s employees aren  t the only ones holding the bag  enron and its chairman  lay  essentially invented market trading in electric power  lay was also a chief energy advisor to president bush  as he had been to bush  s father  along with a handful of other companies  enron profited so handsomely from deregulation that california consumers  except those in areas with municipal power like los angeles  will pay the price in higher electric bills for years  pacific gas  electric declared bankruptcy  and southern california edison nearly did  the state itself is deeply in debt for the power it was forced to buy  major shareholders in enron  including the state employee pension fund  got burned  there is a lot of blame to pass around   after all  edison itself was a main cheerleader for deregulation   but enron remains a fat target 
lay  s tendency to fulminate at the state and its officials at the height of the electricity crisis for not getting onto the free  market bandwagon deepened the wounds  when the price bubble fell victim to this year  s cool summer  a declining economy and the state  s purchase of long  term power contracts  the damage was done 
californians can hope that the securities and exchange commission will require companies to disclose the sorts of shenanigans that concealed enron  s debt  voters can ask themselves whether state legislators  inexperience  a product of term limits  helped produce such a shoddily constructed deal on deregulation 
nothing will bring back the ordinary shareholders  lost money  at least the enron employee lawsuit stands a chance of recovering some percentage of the retirement fund loss  even if not a penny comes from kenneth lay  s   million

dynegy asks enron for new terms

dynegy inc  is insisting on steeply cutting the price of the   billion rescue offer it made to energy trading competitor enron corp   as the companies  executives yesterday continued to hash out financial and legal issues standing in the way of a new agreement 
dynegy confirmed that it was pressing enron for new terms  following the latest collapse of enron  s stock price after the companies  original nov   acquisition agreement 
neither company would discuss the parameters of a new deal  dynegy is believed to be seeking a reduction of about  percent in its original offer  which involved a stock swap and assumption of about   billion in enron debt 
more critical than the stock exchange ratio  however  is how enron will raise more cash and capital to stay solvent over the six to nine months that regulators are expected to take to review a dynegy  enron deal  analysts said  enron has   billion in debts that come due over the next  months 
under the original deal  enron shareholders would receive about     a share   more than twice the stock  s current market value  enron shares closed yesterday at      up  cents  while dynegy closed at      up     
the new york times and wall street journal reported details of the negotiations on monday 
enron has little if any leverage  analysts said  predicting that a breakdown in the negotiations could trigger a series of events that would force the nation  s largest energy trading firm and champion of deregulation into bankruptcy reorganization 
 i don  t think they have a choice   said ralph pellecchia  a credit analyst with the fitch inc  bond  rating service 
enron  s stock   which traded as high as   earlier this year   plummeted after a chain reaction of shocks over the past month tied to enron  s disclosures that some executives were involved in investment partnerships whose debts were kept off enron  s balance sheet  the securities and exchange commission launched an investigation of enron  s finances and enron had to make a     billion reduction in shareholders  equity and acknowledge a   million reduction in earnings for the past four years 
ratings services have withheld new assessments of enron  s creditworthiness while the companies attempt to restructure their deal 
the ratings assessments are critical because enron  s debt is now rated just one step above junk bond status  if it sinks to that level  lenders could begin demanding repayment on more than   billion in enron debt  precipitating what would likely be a fatal cash drain  analysts said 
 enron  s investment grade rating is based in great part on the expectation that the merger with dynegy will go forward   pellecchia said 
growing concerns about enron  s survival have stymied attempts by its bankers  j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup inc   to raise as much as   billion for enron over the past two weeks  the two banks are prepared to advance   million each and are trying to find other lenders willing to advance up to     billion more  according to sources familiar with the plan 
meanwhile  some companies have avoided selling energy to enron  s trading operation  fearing they won  t be paid 
investors and lenders urgently need a clear signal that dynegy is determined to proceed  on new terms  pellecchia and other analysts said  the combination of the two companies would create a dominant trading operation in energy products and related financial instruments  but regulatory reviews are likely to extend for six months or more  and investors want to see whether dynegy is prepared to stay that course 
another ongoing issue is the mounting lawsuits against enron by shareholders and employees  under the merger agreement  dynegy can walk away if it judges that the successful claims against enron from such suits will exceed     billion 
several enron employees have filed suit claiming that the company mismanaged its   k  employee retirement plan  which  combined with concealment of its financial problems  has devastated employees  savings 
the suit cites enron  s policy that the company  s matching contributions would be made only in enron stock  and that employees could not sell these shares until they reached age  
additionally  enron froze the retirement accounts from the close of trading oct    about the time when the depth of its problems was becoming clear  until the morning of nov    in order to make a planned change in the management of the account  a company spokesman said   the employee lawsuit contends that the freeze covered a slightly longer period   during the freeze  employees could not sell enron shares that they had purchased as their retirement contribution 
 the message to employees  investing in enron stock  was  everything was going great   said washington lawyer eli gottesdiener  who represents the employees in the suit

new york   the dramatic slide in the stock of energy trader enron corp  halted tuesday  as its intended rescuer  rival dynegy inc   confirmed that it is renegotiating the terms of the takeover 
wall street read the news as a sign of at least some improvement in the chances that the deal will go through  but enron stock rose only  cents to     in new york stock exchange trading  so confidence in enron  s survivability remains tepid  traders said 
dynegy shares rallied      or    to     on the big board  as investors anticipated a new deal at a lower price 
reached tuesday evening  a spokeswoman for enron said   we don  t expect an announcement tonight  
the two companies  both based in houston  have agreed on a new price of    dynegy share for each enron share  or     a share at tuesday  s closing price for dynegy  a person familiar with the negotiations said tuesday  that revalued figure is more than   below the original price announced nov   
the terms also would include another interim infusion of cash to help stabilize enron  s trading business and enable it to make a    million payment due creditors dec    the person said 
he said it was unclear how big the infusion would be and whether the money all would come from dynegy and its   owner  chevrontexaco corp   or whether a portion would come from enron  s bankers as part of a restructuring of enron  s debt 
chevrontexaco provided enron an immediate     billion in cash at the time the takeover was announced  in return  enron agreed to sell its northern natural gas co  pipeline subsidiary to dynegy 
enron  s efforts to attract additional equity investments of up to   billion so far have failed  bloomberg news reported tuesday that enron  s bankers  led by j  p  morgan chase  co   have had their overtures rejected by saudi prince alwaleed bin talal  carlyle group inc  and blackstone group 
the major credit  rating agencies again tuesday refrained from downgrading enron  s bonds to junk status  awaiting word of a restructured deal 
some analysts theorized that  by deferring a downgrade of enron  s bonds to junk status  rating agencies were cutting the company more slack than normal because they are conscious that such a downgrade would send the company into bankruptcy  that in turn could cause what one analyst termed a meltdown of financial markets  given enron  s long reach in accounting for as much as   of all electric power and natural gas traded globally 
ronald m  barone  analyst at standard  poor  s rating agency in new york  said he was surprised no deal was struck as of tuesday evening   we  re still waiting   he said 
under the terms of some of its controversial deals involving limited partnerships established and run by former enron executives  a rating cut to below investment grade would trigger a requirement that enron make immediate cash payments to creditors  such payments would total     billion  enron said in a recent filing with the securities and exchange commission 
the sec is investigating the limited  partnership arrangements and the circumstances that caused enron to dramatically restate its official financial statements  erasing more than   million in reported profit since  
enron also faces a raft of lawsuits by ordinary stockholders and by employees who contend they were misled about the firm  s financial condition and induced to invest in company stock when executives knew it was overvalued 
enron  s core trading business has been deteriorating as nervous trading partners have reduced their exposure to a possible bankruptcy  said energy analyst michael heim at a  g  edwards those deals are evaporating as enron  s fate remains uncertain  he said

ratings agencies agree to hold off on ratings move on enron for now  wsj
    
afx news
 c   by afp  extel news ltd
new york  afx   representatives of moody  s investors service inc  standard  poor  s corp and fitch inc yesterday agreed to hold off on making any ratings move on the long  term debt of enron corp  which is currently just one notch above junk status  the wall street journal reported citing people close to the talks 
the ratings agencies yesterday met with executives of enron and dynegy inc  which is trying to buy enron  as the companies continued talks aimed at salvaging their two  week old deal 
a downgrade to junk status would be critical for the troubled enron  as it would trigger payment obligations on a large part of its debt  which totals about  bln usd   bln usd of which is due by the end of next year 
the company may find itself on the hook for an additional  bln usd in off  balance  sheet debt and another    bln usd in potential liabilities  related to troubled investment partnerships  if its credit rating drops to below investment grade  fitch analyst ralph pellecchia said  according to the paper 
it would also make it more expensive for the company to raise the financing needed to keep its trading operations alive 
enron yesterday informally agreed to a new share  exchange ratio of    shares of dynegy for each enron share owned  down more than  pct from the original ratio of    dynegy shares for each enron share owned  the paper said 
but the new ratio  which values enron at    usd a share  or a total of    bln usd  compared with the original value of    usd a share  or a total of    bln usd  has not been officially agreed upon  and talks   which are reported to be tense   are set to continue 
the talks began at the weekend  sparked by a steep decline in enron  s share price in the past two weeks following revelations of new liquidity problems in a filing to the sec last week

india  india  s ongc says rejects bg offer on fields 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
bombay  nov   reuters   india  s oil and natural gas corporation  ongc  has rejected a bid by british energy giant bg plc to become the operator of three prized oil and gas fields off india  s west coast  an ongc spokeswoman said on wednesday 
the decision could jeopardise the british oil and gas producer  s    million deal to buy a  percent stake in the fields from u  s  energy firm enron corp 
the deal  signed in october  was conditional on bg becoming the operator of the fields with full control over day  to  day management 
the ongc board  which met late on tuesday evening  decided that bg  s offer was not  sufficiently responsive  for it to become the operator of the fields  the spokeswoman told reuters  she did not elaborate on the reasons for rejecting the bg bid  ongc  s move could also affect enron  which desperately needs cash to stave off a mounting debt crisis in the united states  the houston  based energy trader needs at least   billion cash to shore up its balance sheet and keep rating agencies from junking its debt 
the spokesman for bg was not immediately available for comment 
the panna  mukta and tapti fields  considered one of india  s prized discoveries in the last two decades  were being jointly owned by ongc  enron oil and gas india ltd  wholly  owned unit of enron corp  and reliance industries ltd  the country  s biggest petrochemicals maker 
the panna  mukta oilfields have recoverable reserves of  million barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas  they are proposed to be expanded to   mmboe   the tapti gas field has reserves of    billion cubic metres of gas equivalent 
enron  with  percent stake  was the sole operator  and bg wanted that situation to continue after the buyout 
but this was opposed by ongc and reliance  both companies staked their own independent claims  saying that they had the expertise to manage the fields on their own 
bg then tried to solve the dispute by offering ongc the right to operate another field in brazil if it withdrew its claim for panna  mukta and tapti

australia  pacific hydro to select wind turbine maker 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
melbourne  nov   reuters   renewable power generator pacific hydro ltd said on wednesday it expected to select a wind turbine company to set up australian manufacturing for its proposed a   million portland wind farm by mid  january 
pacific hydro managing director jeff harding said the company had shortlisted danish company neg micon and a consortium of enron corp and siemens 
 we will select them within the next six to eight weeks or so  but the manufacturing will only go ahead if we get approval for the project   he said 
the selected manufacturer would initially provide turbines for the portland project  but harding said it was expected to provide the base for other wind project manufacturing 
a number of companies are looking at boosting wind generation in australia as a result of a federal government target to boost renewable energy use by two percent by  
pacific hydro  s portland project would comprise  wind generators with a capacity of about  mw  and is expecting to gain environmental approvals around april next year 
the company  which also has a range of hydro projects in australia and asia  has identified    mw of potential australian wind generation projects 
 we expect to have a minimum of  mw operational within three to four years   harding said 
pacific hydro is a joint venture partner with aboitiz in the phillipines  mw bakun hydro project which started operation during the past financial year 
work on the second stage of bakun  which will boost output by  percent  is due to start in   with pacific hydro and aboitiz  also planning another hydro project 
pacific hydro reported a net profit after tax and abnormals of a     million for the year ended june   up from a     million the year previously due to the start of bakun and an abnormal foreign exchange benefit 
harding said the profit growth would slow this financial year  with the portland project not likely to make its first contribution until    
 it will be slightly ahead of last year but we won  t have that quantum jump which we had this last year  that reflected the completion of bakun   he said 
pacific hydro shares ended wednesday up seven cents at a      while the broader market was down    percent

the high  profile deal to merge energy marketers enron corp  and dynegy inc  has gone back to the drawing board 
meanwhile  enron reportedly has made progress securing more than     billion in new cash to keep its business stable while it renegotiates with dynegy 
dynegy confirmed tuesday that it is in talks to renegotiate its   billion deal to buy its larger but troubled rival 
the disclosure sent enron shares up    percent  apparently easing some investors  concerns that the deal would fall through 
in trading on the new york stock exchange  enron shares rose  cents to close at       a stark contrast to days of double  digit declines  dynegy shares rose      to     
 there are discussions occurring related to the structure of the transaction   said dynegy spokesman steve stengel 
while news that the two houston  based companies were renegotiating temporarily appeased investors  observers said they won  t be confident about the deal  s future until they hear details about new cash infusions to help keep enron afloat 
 putting more money into the deal to shore up enron  s credit situation  that would be a sign that dynegy would be committed to the deal going through   said analyst mike heim of a  g  edwards  sons 
late tuesday  the financial times of london reported on its web site that a consortium of investors is proposing a   billion equity investment in enron  citing a person close to the talks  the newspaper didn  t identify these investors  but said an agreement could be announced wednesday 
separately  the wall street journal reported on its web site that j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup inc   s citibank  which are advising on the dynegy buyout  have agreed to invest   million in the merged company and have said they would consider increasing that amount if they fail to find additional outside investors for the deal 
the journal  citing people close to the discussions  also said dynegy and enron have tentatively agreed to cut the value of the all  stock deal in half  under the new deal  enron shareholders would get    dynegy share for each enron share held 
that would value enron at     billion  the original deal  valued at   billion  was based on an exchange rate of    dynegy share for each enron share

usa  update   enron  dynegy hammer away at new merger deal

 c  reuters limited  
houston  nov   reuters   energy trader dynegy inc  and floundering rival enron corp  hammered away at new terms for their proposed merger late tuesday  and sources said talks included a buyout offer half the original price and fervent efforts to secure financing to stave off a credit downgrade 
the sources familiar with the negotiations said investment banks j  p  morgan and citigroup  who are advisors and have already loaned enron a total of   billion  may have to step up with a combined   million to help save the deal 
this follows several rebuffs of enron by prominent private equity firms  although a source said the houston company was entertaining an offer of   billion from outside investors 
dynegy had planned to buy its houston rival for   billion in stock and is currently in a  due diligence  examination of enron  s complex financial records that began before the thanksgiving holiday last thursday 
the first buyout offer  finalized nov    would have had dynegy paying about     for each share of enron  but enron  s shares have since cratered to near    stoking investor fears the merger will not go through 
it is abundantly clear that the deal will be changed if it is to proceed  sources close to the negotiations said the stock exchange ratio is likely to fall into the range of    to    dynegy shares for each enron share  about half of the originally proposed valuation of    to  
enron had tentatively accepted the lower end of that range  but a source cautioned that the talks were still very active and the terms very fluid 
also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of enron  s debt past the close of the merger  expected in the third quarter of   as another move against a credit cut 
outside offer entertained
as for the outside offer of   billion  a source said the investment is designed to shore up enron  s balance sheet and keep rating agencies from junking its credit  a credit downgrade would cause some     billion in obligations to become due immediately 
 it  s all about getting money to protect assets and intellectual property   the source told reuters 
an announcement could come as early as wednesday  but it could take longer  the source said 
the source declined to identify the parties  and would neither confirm or deny that goldman sachs was among them  sources close to the investment bank have told reuters recently that goldman is looking at ways to be part of enron  s power trading business 
dynegy spokesman john sousa declined to comment on what he termed speculation about parties to the deal 
enron  s shares bounced slightly on tuesday after dynegy confirmed the restructuring talks  shares closed up  cents at     on the new york stock exchange  dynegy  s shares gained    percent or     to     on the nyse 
another set of clouds darkening enron  s sky is the fact that its pursuit of private equity financing has found few takers among the more prominent private equity firms 
three new york  based buyout firms  blackstone group  clayton dubilier  rice and warburg pincus llc have all passed on enron  according to people familiar with enron  s efforts 
and washington  d  c   based carlyle group  another major private equity firm  is also not interested in enron  carlyle spokesman chris ullman said 
some private equity executives who have looked at enron say too much remains unclear about enron  s financial condition to commit funds in the near future 
one certainty is that layoffs are in enron  s future  three sources confirmed to reuters that enron  s equity trading unit is being closed and that the roughly  employees there are being laid off  an enron spokesman would not comment on the cuts 
those layoffs  part of broader job cuts expected as part of the dynegy buyout  point to an acute problem for enron  the loss of volume in its trading franchise  the crown jewel most coveted by dynegy  enron  s trading partners have been cutting back transactions with north america  s largest energy trader because of credit concerns 
 this business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth  it is the principal reason that dynegy is making the deal  if it  s worth a lot less  then enron is worth less  it  s vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business   said commerzbank analyst andre meade

houston  ap   the high  profile deal to merge energy marketers enron corp  and dynegy inc  has gone back to the drawing board 
meanwhile  enron reportedly has made progress securing more than dlrs    billion in new cash to keep its business stable while it renegotiates with dynegy 
in a move that sent enron shares higher after days of double  digit declines  dynegy confirmed tuesday that it is in talks to renegotiate its dlrs  billion deal to buy its larger but financially troubled rival 
the disclosure that the two companies are revisiting the terms sent enron shares up    percent  apparently easing some investors  concerns that the deal would fall through 
 there are discussions occurring related to the structure of the transaction   said dynegy spokesman steve stengel  who declined to elaborate 
while news that the two houston  based companies were renegotiating temporarily appeased investors  observers said they won  t be confident about the deal  s future until they hear details about new cash infusions to help keep enron afloat 
 putting more money into the deal to shore up enron  s credit situation  that would be a sign that dynegy would be committed to the deal going through   said mike heim  an analyst with a  g  edwards  sons 
late tuesday  the financial times of london reported on its web site that a new consortium of investors is proposing making a dlrs  billion equity investment in enron  citing a person close to the talks  the newspaper didn  t identify these investors  but said an agreement could be announced as soon as wednesday 
separately  the wall street journal reported on its web site that j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup inc   s citibank  which are advising on the dynegy buyout  have agreed to invest dlrs  million in the merged company and have said they would consider increasing that amount if they fail to find additional outside investors to take part in the deal 
the journal  citing people close to the discussions  also said dynegy and enron have tentatively agreed to cut the value of the all  stock deal in half  under a deal informally agreed to by enron  s board  enron shareholders would get    dynegy share for each enron share held 
that would value enron at dlrs    billion  the original deal  valued at dlrs    billion  was based on an exchange rate of    dynegy share for each enron share 
as a condition of the reduced price  enron executives were seeking more control of the combined company  the journal said 
raymond james analyst jon kyle cartwright said the buyout will hinge on dynegy  s ability to reinvigorate enron  s trading operation  which has been hurt as some energy companies have stopped selling it power and natural gas for fear they won  t be paid 
many energy traders who have shied away from doing business with enron worry that the company will go bankrupt  said charlie sanchez  energy markets manager for gelber  associates  a houston  based energy trading firm 
restoring customer and investor faith  is not impossible  but it  s more of an issue of gradually rebuilding  enron  s  confidence and legacy and developing confidence in the new legacy under dynegy  it  s just going to take time   he said 
but fadel gheit  an analyst with fahnestock  co  inc  said enron is a bad investment and that dynegy underestimated its potential liabilities after it announced nov   that it would buy the company at a price valuing enron at about dlrs  per share  under the terms of the deal  dynegy also would assume dlrs  billion in enron debt 
 chasing enron is like trying to catch a falling knife   gheit wrote tuesday in a research note to investors 
stengel  the dynegy spokesman  declined comment when asked if an announcement of renegotiated terms is expected soon  enron spokesman vance meyer said the company had no comment about any discussions related to the merger and that enron expected the deal to be completed 
in trading on the new york stock exchange  enron shares rose  cents to close at dlrs     a stark contrast to trading a day earlier that saw enron shares dip to an all  time low of dlrs    before closing down  percent at dlrs     dynegy shares rose dlrs    to dlrs    on the nyse 
enron  s stock has plummeted more than  percent from its february   week high of dlrs     after a series of disclosures relating to the company  s complicated finances raised concerns about its financial viability 
enron last month revealed that partnerships run by its executives had allowed the company to keep about half a billion in debt off its books and allowed the executives to profit from the arrangements  enron  s dealings with those partnerships are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation 
the company ousted its top financial officer in october  and several weeks ago restated its earnings back to   eliminating more than dlrs  million in reported income

usa  enron woes bite into its energy trading 
by james jelter
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
san francisco  nov   reuters   former energy trading giant enron  s financial straits and plunging share price are drying up its core business as other market players seek out safer trading partners 
while most u  s  utilities and trading houses say they are still striking deals with enron  they also admit now to slashing their financial exposure to the battered company 
 we haven  t stopped trading with enron   said terry francisco  a spokesman for rival duke energy 
 we will continue to closely monitor the situation and make prudent adjustments when necessary in accordance with our credit policies   he added 
for enron  those policies are starting to sting 
the company has seen its credit rating cut to just above  junk  status following disclosure of off  balance sheet dealings by a senior officer and a downward revision of its earnings for the past four years 
enron  which until recently handled  percent of the north american electricity and natural gas market  has seen its share price plummet from a year high of     to close today at a mere     on the new york stock exchange 
cross  town rival dynegy inc  agreed earlier this month to buy enron in a stock deal valued at     a share 
but given enron shares  continued slump  dynegy said tuesday it was seeking to renegotiate the deal 
dearth of sellers
amid all this bad news  energy traders said they were now reluctant to sell energy to enron 
this  in turn  has raised concerns enron might have a hard time securing enough power and gas to meet its long  term sales commitments  though there so far has been no evidence it has missed any deliveries or failed to pay for what it buys 
nevertheless  mirant corp   another of the nation  s top energy trading houses  confirmed tuesday it was no longer willing to sell energy products to enron 
 right now  we  re just purchasing from them   mirant spokesman chuck griffin said 
this cautionary approach was also confirmed at several municipal and federal power companies  including the mighty bonneville power administration  bpa  in portland  oregon 
 we have severely limited our business with enron   said stephen oliver  vice president of power marketing for bpa  which sells wholesale electricity from a string of huge dams along the northwest  s columbia river 
oliver said bpa  which has done business with enron for six years  owes the company money but he declined to say how much 
 we have zeroed out their credit limit  and any business going forward with enron would be within the amount of money owed to them   he said 
payment up front
enron  s shaky financial status has prompted some traders to demand payment up front  a move taken by the western area power administration  wapa   which markets hydroelectricity from  federal dams for the u  s  department of energy 
wapa spokeswoman laverne kyriss said some of their regional offices have halted spot market dealings with enron and are seeking to renegotiate a   year deal to buy power from enron 
 we are working to protect our utility customers and the federal government   kyriss said 
traders throughout the utility industry said they had curbed or dropped long  term trades with enron  which involve deals lasting anywhere from a week to several years 
as enron  s financial woes deepen  traders said they are searching for  sleeves   or middlemen  to provide a financial buffer in brokered spot market deals with the company 
in such a deal  a utility  for example  will offer to sell its surplus electricity or gas through a broker  trusting the broker to line up the best anonymous bid in the market 
if the top bidder turns out to be enron  many utilities will turn down the deal unless they have a middleman willing to take ownership and guarantee payment of the energy being sold 
this allows a utility trader to indirectly conduct business with enron while staying within the utility  s credit limits 
taking a toll
the toll all this is taking on enron  s business is hard to measure 
enron  like most trading houses  does not disclose its market positions or how much of its activity is wrapped up at any given time in natural gas or electricity  its two biggest markets  or its other energy and financial transactions 
 we don  t break things out by type of product   enron spokesman eric thode said 
thode said the company had seen a drop in trading volume  about  percent of which is conducted over its prized enrononline internet trading system and  percent in the over  the  counter market 
but the company  s   day rolling trade average showed enron was doing about    transactions a day  with a daily notional value of     billion  which is well within its daily average of    to    transactions this year 
 certainly  our volumes have dropped below our   day rolling average    but confidence is still being shown by the great majority of our trading partners   thode said

bruce francis  cnnfn anchor  markets impact  well  some on wall street doubt that enron  url  http     www  enron  com   can survive until the merger  and our next guest is one of them 
kathleen hays  cnnfn anchor  markets impact  brian youngberg is a utilities analyst at edward jones  he  s joining us now from st  louis  welcome 
brian youngberg  utilities analyst  edward jones  thank you for having
me 
hays  well  we  re happy to have you here  brian 
but this unhappy situation with enron  this is like a soap opera that just gets worse and worse by the day  and you  re   you are
then fairly pessimistic that anything  s going to come of this 
youngberg  well  i think they may announce some sort of restructuring  you know  the problem i have right now is really the time frame  you know  you  re
talking of having the company  enron  surviving for another nine months or so on its own  it  s struggled to survive these last two weeks since the original deal was announced 
so  you
know  dynegy  url  http    www  dynegy  com   has to decide  you know  how much more capital they want to put into enron to help shore up the company before they get to closing  so  you know  even if they
do announce a restructuring  it  s still not a done deal 
francis  could it be clear to dynagy at this point that there are assets at enron that are worth accept   taking on
all that risk 
youngberg  well  i think dynagy  you know  has to be evaluating that  you know  the thing they  re buying here as far as assets is really   are really the people and the trading
floor  the pipelines they  re acquiring  which are good pipelines  but they have a lot of debt against them 
so  you know  they have to decide  you know  is this worth continuing to pursue  or let it
go by the wayside and move forward on their own  you know  dynagy in general is viewed as a very solid company  whether or not they acquire enron or not 
hays  so   and i guess besides
the debt they would take on  we were just   casey wian in houston just talking to an attorney who  s getting all kinds of clients who feel they were betrayed  and obviously
there  s  you know  legal ramifications  i guess that  s another liability that dynagy has to assess in whether or not it makes this transaction 
youngberg  right  i think dynagy has already looked at   you know  they assume that
there will be some significant litigation  you know  issues and losses  possibly  as far as shareholder lawsuits and so forth  and i think they  ve already built that into it 
the question is  you know  is there something
more out there that we don  t know  and maybe even dynagy itself doesn  t know 
francis  is there another potential acquirer out there  or is dynagy the acquirer of the last resort for  inaudible    
youngberg  i really
do believe that dynagy is really the only party that  s really that interested in enron at this point in time  you know  there  s just too much hanging over the company right
now with an sec investigation  possible further losses  a declining share in mar   in energy trading and so forth  liquidity issues 
there  s just too much for  i think  most other companies to really take on  and if
any company knows the insides of enron  i think it would probably be dynagy at this point in time 
hays   inaudible   you know  this is   i can  t think of anything to offset any of
this  because everything you say  it  s hard to find an argument against 
in fact  if anything  you  d think dynagy would be better off to wait until they  re in bankruptcy proceedings and then buy
whatever pieces of the company are on the block 
francis  or just steal the customers 
hays  yes 
youngberg  well  i think the problem with waiting for them to go into bankruptcy  and dynagy has to weigh this
also  is that you get in that situation  you don  t know what the bankruptcy judge could decide in those situations  there could be other parties that  you know  partake in the bidding
for the pipelines  for example  you know  they may not get all the assets they really do want 
so they do have to make some very tough decisions  and i think that  s why they  re   they  ve
taken this past weekend  they  ve taken at least a couple more days here  and they really want to make sure  you know  their next step is the right one for
them  and  you know  we  ll just have to wait and see  you know  what comes of this 
you know  our view is  we are recommending individual investors that hold shares of enron to sell  move on  there  s plenty of
other better companies in the sector that have better track records  better outlooks  and really just overall better fundamentals at this point in time 
francis  brian youngberg  thank you for joining us  we
appreciate it 
youngberg  thank you

enron board agrees to lower dynegy purchase price  paper says
         new york 
houston  nov    bloomberg    enron corp   s board agreed to
a reduced dynegy inc  purchase offer that values the energy
trader  s equity at     billion  less than half of the original
price  the wall street journal reported  citing a personal
familiar with the plan 
the new exchange ratio of    share of dynegy for each enron
share would value enron at     a share  the journal said  that  s
 percent above enron  s closing stock price today and down from
the original ratio of     the agreement isn  t final  the paper
said 
enron and dynegy executives are trying to save the
transaction amid growing concern about enron  s cash  flow problems 
enron shares have fallen  percent this year as investors
questioned whether the company was using affiliated partnerships
to hide losses and debt  and some lenders stopped providing enron
with cash 
in exchange for a lower purchase price  some at enron are
seeking more control over the combined company  the journal said 
dynegy is prepared to invest at least   million in enron 
on top of the     billion in cash from dynegy investor
chevrontexaco corp   the new york times said  citing executives
close to the talks  dynegy wants the cash backed by assets  and
the companies are having a hard time finding enough enron holdings
that aren  t already mortgaged to creditors  the paper said

enron finding it harder to trade  competitors say  update  
 adds magnum hunter comment in  st   rd paragraphs  
houston  nov     bloomberg    enron corp  is finding it
harder to buy natural gas or power because some trading partners
have lost confidence the company will have the cash to pay bills 
spokesmen for other energy companies say 
mirant corp  traders won  t sell natural gas or power to
enron  though the atlanta  based energy trader will buy from the
company  said james peters  mirant spokesman  aquila inc   s
business with enron also is   all on the buy side    said al
butkus  an aquila spokesman 
dynegy is in talks to lower the price of its acquisition of
enron from its current   billion in stock and assumed debt  the
talks are a sign that the trading operations  which provide more
than  percent of enron  s revenue  are in trouble  analysts say 
  if they are renegotiating  it confirms our fears that
enron  s crown jewel   its marketing and trading business   is
deteriorating    said andre meade  an analyst with commerzbank
securities 
enron spokesman eric thode said enron  s trading operations
remain strong  volume on enrononline  the company  s internet  based
trading site  has averaged    transactions a day with a value
of     billion over the last  days  enrononline handles about
 percent of the company  s trading business  thode said 
paying higher premiums
companies that continue to do business with enron are forcing
it to pay premium prices  said arthur gelber  president of gelber
 associates corp  in houston  which advises  producers on their
trading strategies 
companies are charging enron about     for a million
british thermal units of natural gas  where they would charge a
buyer with better credit      gelber said 
profit margins on energy sales are slim  and   it  s very
difficult   for enron  s traders to turn a profit if they have to
pay more than competitors  gelber said 
other sellers are requiring enron to provide large letters of
credit showing it has the cash to complete a deal  gelber said  a
typical natural gas deal  such as a delivery of  billion british
thermal units a day for a month  might require a letter of credit
for as much as     
competitors don  t face some of the problems that enron does
guaranteeing trades  analysts said  because they have their own
power plants and natural gas supplies to meet commitments  enron
has few such assets  and must purchase most of its supplies 
  we  re seeing the repercussion of enron  s strategy that had
been so unorthodox   for them to not rely on physical generation
assets    said will mcnamara  director of electric industry
analysts at consultant scientech inc 
  because they don  t have their own assets to rely on 
they  ve got to go out and get the power from somebody else   
which is becoming more difficult and expensive because of the
company  s credit problems  mcnamara said 
lowering exposure
some partners have long  term contracts with enron and don  t
want it to fail until they can find alternative suppliers or hedge
existing contracts  traders say 
  most people want enron to survive for a certain amount of
time to get their exposure down    said mike loya  president of
vitol sa  a closely held energy company with offices in houston 
  we continue to trade with enron cautiously   
companies that are buying from enron may be doing so to
offset agreements to sell back to the company later  a technique
for reducing the potential losses if a partner fails to meet its
obligations  traders said 
shares declined
enron shares have fallen  percent this year as the
investors questioned whether the company was using affiliated
partnerships to hide losses and debt  and some lenders stopped
providing enron with cash 
enron shares rose  cents to     today  down from a high
of     on dec    dynegy rose     to      down   
percent from nov   when the merger was announced  shares of
chevrontexaco  which owns  percent of dynegy  rose  cents to
    
in october  the company said shareholder equity was lowered
by     billion because it used stock to pay off a partnership  s
debt  on nov    the company lowered earnings back to  by  
million to reflect losses incurred by the partnerships 
last week  enron said it may be forced to pay a   million
note owed by one of the partnerships and may write off  
million in the fourth quarter to reflect a debt it is backing for
another partnership with stock 
debt
enron is trying to renegotiate more than   billion in debt
payments owed before the end of   as well as secure as much as
  billion from outside investors who will take a stake in the
company  without more money  enron may run short of cash it needs
to guarantee trades  analysts say 
credit concerns prompted magnum hunter resources inc   an oil
and natural gas producer in irving  texas  to stop selling gas to
enron from the largest producing property it controls in the gulf
of mexico 
the company is still selling gas to enron from two smaller
properties  with the purchases backed by letters of credit 
because enron was one of the few companies willing to give small
companies credit a few years ago  when oil and gas prices were
low 
  we have always appreciated them standing by us when
commodity prices were low    said magnum hunter chief financial
officer chris tong 
some large industrial natural gas and electricity users are
avoiding signing long  term contracts with enron  industry
consultants said 
  why would you go with a supplier where there  s uncertainty 
when you can go with one where there  s certainty    asked mark
