subject  bnycp litigation analysis  privileged and confidential
attached are the memoranda prepared by outside counsel assessing the bnycp litigation  to avoid as much confusion as possible  i suggest reading the andrews  kurth memo first  the bernstein memo second and the risk matrix last 
in a nutshell  all agree that this is a very fact intensive case and that there has been little factual discovery to date  it is also agreed that we have been denied the benefit of some of the evidence available as a result of the confidentiality obligations in place  accordingly  much of the analysis provided is really counsel  s  best guess  based on the information available 
that being said  there seems to be a general agreement that  based on the facts currently available and the  quick and dirty  analysis that we have been able to do  the exposure ranges from approximately   to   million  interest and attorney fees could also prove significant 
i am available to discuss this further if you think that would be helpful  thanks for your patience
