in another potentially serious blow to enron corp   s finances  moody  s investors service inc  lowered its ratings by one notch on the energy company  s senior unsecured debt and kept the company under review for a possible further downgrade 
it also was learned that the securities and exchange commission has moved its inquiry into enron  s finances to the agency  s washington headquarters from its regional office in fort worth  texas  the change is a sign that the probe is being treated as a high priority  according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry  an sec spokesman declined to comment 
moody  s reduction on enron  s senior unsecured long  term debt to baa  from baal leaves the company  s credit rating two levels above noninvestment grade  if the energy  trading giant  s ratings were to fall to a noninvestment  grade level  there could be serious consequences for enron  it could throw the houston company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings and force it under the terms of various financial agreements to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt  which would dilute the value of existing shares 
while enron still has some room before hitting noninvestment  grade status  there have been concerns among analysts and investors that the company  s recent troubles could escalate  during recent days enron  s bonds have traded at levels similar to securities that carry a noninvestment  grade rating  prices of the company  s bonds improved somewhat yesterday  though its stock price continued to fall sharply  in  p  m  new york stock exchange composite trading  enron stock was at      down     or    and topped the most  active list with    million shares changing hands  enron  s share price has fallen more than   during the past two weeks 
an enron spokeswoman said the company is  working diligently  to keep an investment  grade credit rating  among other things  the nation  s biggest energy  trading firm is in negotiations with its banks on a new   billion to   billion credit line to bolster its liquidity  enron repeatedly has said its business operations remain strong 
yesterday  s ratings downgrade is the latest piece of bad news for a company that has been engulfed in turmoil during the past two weeks  confidence in its financial situation was shaken after enron earlier this month announced a   million third  quarter loss and disclosed a     billion erosion of shareholder equity related to transactions it had carried out with entities connected to its then  chief financial officer  andrew fastow  last week  enron named a successor to mr  fastow and said the sec was looking into the deals 
the sec is looking into whether enron violated federal  securities laws regarding its handling and disclosure of the transactions connected to mr  fastow  the person familiar with the probe said  generally  the sec  s headquarters office has more resources to apply to complex  high  profile cases than regional offices do  moving the enron inquiry to headquarters indicates that the sec is looking to make a decision relatively quickly about whether or not to allege securities  law violations by the company  this person said 
enron repeatedly has said the transactions were proper and legal  yesterday  the enron spokeswoman said the company is continuing to cooperate with the sec probe and is gathering and sending the agency information that it requested 
moody  s said the downgrade was  prompted by the deterioration in enron  s financial flexibility   which has contributed to  a substantial loss in investor confidence   going forward  moody  s said it will focus on enron management  s  success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability  from major trading partners  enron is a principal in nearly one  quarter of all electricity and natural  gas trades in the nation

shares of the enron corporation fell sharply yesterday after moody  s investors service lowered the company  s credit rating  igniting concern that it might have more difficulty raising the cash it needs to finance day  to  day operations 
moody  s lowered enron  s senior unsecured long  term debt ratings to baa   two levels above so  called junk status  from baal 
moody  s also said it might downgrade enron  s commercial paper rating  which could make it harder for the company  the nation  s largest energy  trading concern  to borrow the short  term cash it needs to run its trading business in the future  the company borrowed from banks to repay   billion in commercial paper last week  it is trying to raise   billion to   billion in additional financing from banks 
  a credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their borrowing power    said joe correnti  who follows enron for wayne hummer investments in chicago    that  s not a good place for them to be  they have somewhat aggressive expansion plans   
shares of enron  which is based in houston  plunged      or    percent  to      continuing the daily trading losses dating to oct    when enron reported     billion in losses from investments outside its business of trading commodities like electricity and natural gas 
the company  s stock  which is down almost  percent in a week  is falling faster than the company  s debt because the bond holders have first claim on assets after bank loans are paid 
after the moody  s downgrade  the company  s    percent bonds maturing in  fell  cents  to  cents on each   of face value  yields have risen to    percent  up from    percent before that downgrade  traders said  the bonds were trading at face value the week before 
moody  s said the cut was prompted by the   deterioration in enron  s financial flexibility   since the write  downs and charges  investment partnerships involving the company  s former chief financial officer that had not been disclosed before this month   led to a substantial loss in investor confidence    moody  s said 
andrew fastow  the former chief financial officer  resigned  and the securities and exchange commission asked for information about the transactions he conducted for the partnerships he headed 
enron  s recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit  rating reduction    this move was anticipated    said mike dineen  who holds enron bonds in the   billion of fixed  income assets he helps manage at the mony life insurance company 
enron  s long  term credit ratings outlook was changed last week to negative from stable by standard  poor  s  s   p  affirmed the company  s rating of bbb   the equivalent of moody  s baal

moody  s investors service yesterday downgraded the long  term debt ratings of enron  the us energy group  citing  the deterioration in enron  s financial flexibility  over the past two weeks 
moody  s was the first of the main rating agencies to downgrade the struggling houston  based company  s debt by lowering it from three to just two notches above  junk  status 
moody  s began reviewing enron for a possible downgrade on october   when the company disclosed a surprising dollars    bn reduction in shareholder equity tied to controversial financing vehicles set up by andrew fastow  then chief financial officer 
mr fastow was replaced last week  as enron  s share and bond prices plunged on concerns about other possible disclosures  the securities and exchange commission is undertaking an informal inquiry into the group  s financial dealings 
enron has been forced to seek additional credit from banks after raising dollars    bn in cash last week to boost its financial position 
investors have grown increasingly wary about a company that has long been a wall street favourite  its stock has fallen by more than  per cent since october   and its bond prices are trading at levels technically considered  junk  status 
 moody  s actions are prompted by the deterioration in enron  s financial flexibility since the company announced significant write  downs as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments   moody  s said   this led to a substantial loss in investor confidence  
even as the us rating agency lowered the company  s senior unsecured long  term debt ratings from baal to baa   it said they remained on review for downgrade  moody  s also placed enron  s prime  rating for commercial paper on review  yesterday enron  s stock closed the day off dollars        per cent  at dollars    and its five  year bond was quoted at about  cents in the dollar  sell  or  buy poser  page  private equity woes  page  www  ft  com  enron

global investing  private equity woes sap enron  s energy
financial times  oct   
enron has just provided the world with another lesson in the difficulties of public companies investing in private equity 
on october  the company  s management announced a dollars    bn charge and a dollars    bn reduction to shareholders  equity arising from ljm  co  investment and ljm cayman  two structured products designed to protect it against the fluctuation in value of its private equity investments 
andrew fastow  who was last week replaced as the chief financial officer of the houston  based energy trading giant  set up a private equity fund called ljm  designed to fund enron transactions 
ljm deals did not normally appear on enron  s balance sheet  and that may have been the point of the structure 
a financial engineer explained that enron could have set up a fund  whose changing valuations did not increase the volatility of the trading company  s earnings  by taking only a minority stake in the ljm fund with some passive co  investors 
the investors would normally receive a debt  like pay  off  except in cases where the value of the private equity holdings fell  when they would get compensation in enron shares 
the value of the portfolio  which included investments in the new power company and some broadband companies  did fall precipitously  by the end of last quarter enron was obliged to issue  m shares to the passive investors to compensate them  but instead it ended up taking large cash charges 
was it worth all this trouble for enron to keep its volatile private equity holdings off its balance sheet  obviously not 
mr fastow has now taken a leave of absence and the securities and exchange commission has launched an informal investigation into whether enron  s transactions with the ljm companies were really completed at arms  length  the company  s market capitalisation has halved and its bonds are trading at distressed levels 
but there could still be a good argument for enron being in private equity  it is almost as much a technology company as it is an energy one and as such it might make sense to outsource some of its research and development to a corporate venture capital unit 
the problem is shareholders  dim view of private equity  shareholders refused to give chase manhattan bank a growth multiple when venture capital made up a large proportion of its earnings  but punished its successor  jp morgan chase  when it took a succession of private equity write  downs 
jp morgan chase claims a  per cent internal rate of return on its investments since inception  but investors have remained stubbornly fixated on private equity  s short  term valuation swings 
the bank is now in the process of raising outside money for its private equity fund  jp morgan partners  in an effort to take some of its investment off the balance sheet and change the business into a steady revenue producer 
private equity professionals argue that those swings are often meaningless anyway because half way through the life of many private equity investments  their valuations tend to look far worse than they end up 
in enron  s case it might have been easier for investors to keep their eyes on the long term  if the short  term outlook had been a little clearer  the trading company has faced severe criticism for its lack of disclosure to investors 
ironically  the energy company  s subtle balance sheet games may in the short term have increased the allure of the company  s trading businesses  which continue to perform strongly and experience impressive growth  and for that reason it could probably be argued that mr fastow thought he was serving enron  s interests by managing the partnerships  although he is also reported to have been very well compensated for the service 
long  term the partnerships have clearly undermined enron  s reputation for plain dealing still further 
the saddest thing for the corporate world is that enron is arguably a more natural private equity investor than jp morgan  as a financial institution  jp morgan is arguably most interested in the short  term synergies private equity creates with its other businesses  high capital charges that bank private equity holdings will soon attract will make them less attractive as long  term investments 
enron was investing in new businesses that it thought would help make its own businesses grow  it was harnessing the immense entrepreneurial power of private equity to make its business grow 
the first reaction of investors and regulators will be to punish enron for its shenanigans  later someone might want to think about changing the mark to market system that drove it to these extraordinary lengths

shares in enron  the energy trading company  continued their downward spiral yesterday  with investors responding coolly to reports that the houston company was seeking new credit lines 
at midday the stock was down  per cent at     
investor anger has been focused on enron executives who still have much to explain about several off  balance  sheet vehicles and potential conflicts of interest for the company  s former chief financial officer 
wall street analysts are beginning to rethink their overwhelmingly favourable guidance earlier in the year 
 if i could go back to july and downgrade the stock again  i would certainly do that   said curt launer  analyst at credit suisse first boston   i can  t go back  the question is  what are you going to do today  today  i would like to buy it because of the valuations  
mr launer continues to rate enron as a  strong buy  and he is not alone  despite weeks of turbulent financial disclosures  the august departure of enron  s chief executive  jeff skilling  and the more recent departure of cfo andrew fastow  analysts have wavered little in their initial bullishness 
among analysts who issue recommendations on the company  nine are  strong buys   five are  buys  and only one is a  strong sell   according to thomson financial  first call 
there is no doubt the recent turmoil at enron has created a new difficulty for analysts  do they hold on and hope for an upturn despite continued questions about the company  s disclosure quality  or do they recommend that investors unload their holdings for fears that problems could mount 
they are defending their recommendations based on enron  s strong track record  net income  on an operating basis  surged  per cent last year to     bn  on revenues more than doubled to   bn  during the past  years  enron  s market capitalisation surged from   bn to a peak of   bn  even today analysts point to enron  s strong position in key sectors of power and gas trading 
however  at least one independent research firm decided to tell investors to get out early  off wall street consulting group in cambridge  massachusetts  put enron on its  sell  list in early may when the shares traded just below   
 we discussed the partnerships  former cfo  fastow was involved in and that there was not much detail there   said mark roberts  analyst at ows   their accounting is extraordinarily difficult to get through and when people make things that difficult there  s usually a reason  
despite their relative optimism  most analysts say more bad news could follow 
 the clear immediate task for enron is to make sure it has enough liquidity to help maintain its credit rating   said andre meade  head of us utility research at commerzbank securities 
mr meade issued a  hold  recommendation early last year  but has since upgraded to  accumulate  as the stock became more affordable   we  ve been saying the numbers have been coming in and they have been hitting earnings  estimates   but  some of its  businesses are black boxes and you don  t know how the company is making money from quarter to quarter  
yesterday a new note of caution was sounded by carol levenson  fixed  income analyst at gimme credit research group   the ensuing total collapse of management credibility and market confidence could have negative credit implications far beyond the potential financial impact disclosed so far   she said

enron corp  saw its long  term debt rating lowered by one notch monday  sending the stock to seven  year lows and further hampering the company  s efforts to restore investor and client confidence 
moody  s investors service downgraded enron  s rating from baal to baa   where it will remain on review for further downgrade  moody  s said in a statement  the firm also placed the houston company  s prime   rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade

bad things  it seems  often happen in threes  if that  s so  wall street could be facing a bout of deja vu 
three financial stories currently unfolding bear a slim resemblance to events that nearly caused gridlock in global financial markets in   the analogy is strained  but so are nerves in the post  sept   era  case in point  the dow jones industrial average fell more than  points monday   its biggest point loss since the week after markets reopened following the attacks   despite a lack of dramatically downbeat news 
one of the closely watched sagas on wall street  the deepening problems at energy trading innovator enron  is being compared to the tragically flawed long  term capital management private investment fund 
at long  term capital  professional investors with impressive resumes made a series of disastrous bets  requiring a government  induced bailout in  by major financial institutions that had financed their schemes with massive loans 
on monday  houston  based enron struggled to raise emergency cash as its stock fell another  percent  to     
enron shares  which have fallen from above   at the end of last year  have collapsed more than  percent this month as analysts began to question mysterious financial deals between the company and company insiders  last week  enron  s chief financial officer was replaced 
there was no indication monday that enron  s troubles have impaired the natural gas and electricity markets  nor has the enron predicament yet sparked a backdraft on its lenders 
the two other strings of the story   debt problems at a sovereign nation and currency imbalances   seem relevant only by coincidence 
the implosion at long  term capital occurred amid a surprise default by russia on international debts  separately  currencies of several asian countries ran aground a second year  events that deepened long  term capital  s woes 
current speculation that argentina will default on   billion of international debts hardly represents a shock similar to the russian debt default  the problems of argentina  s economy and financial system  while serious  have been well  known for months 
on monday  argentina hired a merrill lynch consultant  jacob frankel  to craft a financial restructuring and said a workout plan will be disclosed in a few days 
meanwhile  monday  s slide in the value of the dollar in foreign currency markets reversed the dollar  s surprising strength in the wake of the attacks 
indeed  the relative stability of the dollar has been a major contributor to investor confidence  the current slippage by the dollar hardly indicates extraordinary instability 
as far as we know  enron was not engaged in currency speculation or deals pegged to argentina  but enron shareholders and the securities and exchange commission have just begun to investigate 
monday  s action  stocks closed broadly lower in light trading monday  as investors awaited several key economic reports due out this week  including friday  s scheduled report on job losses and the unemployment rate in october 
treasury securities rallied on expectations that the economic downturn will be more pronounced and longer than many investors believe and will prompt the federal reserve to cut interest rates through the end of the year 
the dow jones industrial average fell    points  or    percent  to     chicago  based boeing  which lost a major defense contract to rival lockheed martin  led the dow losers  boeing lost      or    percent  to     
only one of the  dow industrials  sbc communications  posted a gain 
the broader standard  poor  s  index dropped     or    percent  to     new york stock exchange trading volume reached    billion shares  as losing stocks outnumbered winners by    
the nasdaq composite index fell     or    percent  to     nasdaq trading volume totaled    billion shares  losers topped winners by nearly    among nasdaq stocks 
computer networking giant cisco systems led the nasdaq most  active list  dropping  cents  to      a  g  edwards revoked its  strong buy  rating on the stock 
the russell  index of small  company stocks lost     or    percent  to    
fund flows  mutual fund investors withdrew a net     billion from equity funds in september  the biggest one  month dollar amount for net redemptions  according to the investment company institute  the trade association for mutual funds 
the redemptions equaled less than  percent of assets in stock funds  compared with more than  percent withdrawn in october   reflecting the stock market crash of that month  by contrast  cash flow last month into money  market funds soared by   billion 
treasury auction  interest rates fell again at the treasury  s weekly auction of   month and   month bills 
the discount rate for   month bills was    percent  the lowest rate since august   the rate for   month bills was    percent  the lowest rate on record 
the coupon  equivalent investment rates at monday  s auction were    percent for   month bills and    percent for   month bills  bill barnhart

enron corp   s shares fell near a seven  year low monday  as the limping energy giant said it was lobbying banks for a new credit line and a rating agency chopped enron  s senior unsecured debt to two notches above junk status 
the nation  s largest natural gas and power marketing company is struggling to bounce back from disappointing third  quarter earnings and a scandal over losses stemming from partnerships managed by the company  s former chief financial officer 
enron shares fell more than  percent  or     a share  to close at     on the new york stock exchange  a year ago  enron stock sold at nearly   a share 
the ratings cut by moody  s investors service  which warned it could slash that rate again and also enron  s short  term debt status  was the latest sword thrust into what was once the raging bull of the energy trading arena 
meanwhile  enron on monday confirmed it was seeking additional credit lines after tapping its     billion lines last week  but declined to say how much it was asking its banks to extend

moody  s said it may downgrade enron  s commercial paper rating  which would make it harder for the firm to borrow the short  term cash needed to run its trading businesses  ahead of a potential cut  enron took out bank lines to repay   billion in commercial paper last week 
 they  ve pretty much already written off coming to the commercial paper market   said shannon bass  who holds enron bonds in the   million he helps manage at pacific investment management co   the real issue now is trying to get their house in order  
enron shares plunged      or    to close at a seven  year low of     on the new york stock exchange  continuing a slide that dates back to oct    the day after enron reported     billion in losses from investments outside its energy trading business  the stock has fallen about   since oct   
enron has lost more than   billion in market value this year  on dec    enron had a market value of     billion  on monday  the value was     billion

houston   enron corp   s stock slid further monday  pushed down in part by moody  s investors service announcing a downgrade of the company  s credit rating 
the downgrade came as enron negotiates with banks to establish new credit lines as the nation  s largest natural gas and power marketing company struggles to bounce back from disappointing third  quarter earnings and a scandal over losses stemming from partnerships managed by the company  s former chief financial officer 
in composite trading monday at  p  m  on the new york stock exchange  enron  ene  shares were down      or      at      a year ago  enron stock traded at nearly   a share 
enron  s efforts to acquire more credit came after the company last week decided to cash in about   billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence 
 we are in discussions about new credit lines   enron spokeswoman karen denne said monday   we  re taking action to restore investor and market confidence  
ms  denne wouldn  t disclose how much credit the company was seeking  the wall street journal reported in its monday editions that the amount is between   billion and   billion and that the deal is close to being completed 
ms  denne said of the   billion in credit enron cashed in last week    billion of it was used to pay short term debt  currently  there are no plans for the other   billion  she said 
moody  s on monday lowered enron  s senior unsecured long  term debt ratings from baal to baa  where they remain on review for downgrade  moody  s additionally placed the company  s prime   rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade  citing  substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses  
houston  based enron is the nation  s biggest energy trader and a principal in nearly one  quarter of all electricity and natural  gas trades  once a favorite of wall street  the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convincing a deeply concerned investment community that  despite difficulties  its finances remain sound 
confidence in enron  s situation was shaken after enron earlier this month announced a   million third  quarter loss and disclosed a     billion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then  chief financial officer  andrew fastow 
moody  s said in a press release the  magnitude of the announced charges will reduce enron  s equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over   while slashing earnings  
enron  s debt is still investment grade at both moody  s and standard  poor  s and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment  grade category

the commission is considering changes to the pricing formula
it set after skyrocketing electricity costs led to insolvency for
california  s largest utilities  units of pg  e corp  and edison
international  commissioners have said they want to fine  tune the
formula before winter  the peak period of demand in the northwest 
the current pricing formula is based on the most  expensive
power generated in california  power suppliers and utilities in
the pacific northwest  which want to make sure they have enough
power for customers  want the limits to reflect costs from all
generators in the region 
representatives for the california public utilities
commission and edison international  s southern california edison
said the price limits work and should be continued  california
puc  s bill julian said the mitigation plan  due to expire sept 
    should be extended until california  s utilities are
rehabilitated 
prices lower
the cost of wholesale power in california has dropped since
ferc ordered the first emergency cap on april   the average
price for a megawatt  hour at the california  oregon border in
september was      down from     in april  a megawatt  hour
is enough electricity to power about  average california homes
for an hour 
one adjustment under consideration would link the pricing
formula to the cost of natural gas  a fuel used to generate about
 percent of power in the western u  s   more during low 
hydropower years 
the caps were extended to other western states   oregon 
washington  arizona  nevada  wyoming  new mexico  colorado 
montana  idaho and utah   in june because some said generators in
the west could simply get around the cap by selling outside
california when prices were higher elsewhere

washington   the pacific northwest could see power shortages this winter if federal price controls on western power markets aren  t modified or dropped  electricity industry officials warned federal regulators monday 
the controls  first structured to protect california from another punishing summer  are inappropriate to the northwest  where demand is highest in the winter  the officials said 
 the western interconnection is an interdependent market  but that does not mean that there is or should be a single price across the market   said richard tabors  a consultant to power suppliers and a lecturer at massachusetts institute of technology   setting prices in the winter  peaking northwest based on prices set in summer  peaking california and the southwest makes little sense  
the caution came at a federal energy regulatory commission technical conference designed to help the agency frame possible changes to a june price  control order capping prices in california and  other western states 
the controls work by establishing a proxy for a fair maximum market price for the entire region based on the most expensive generator called into service during power emergencies in california  the proxy  price formula takes into account the cost of natural gas fuel  emissions  control credits and the efficiency of power plants 
but california  which experiences peak demand for electricity in the summer  is unlikely to run into a supply crunch again until next year  that means the price cap set in june will remain in effect throughout the winter  when the pacific northwest experiences its peak  demand period and may need the flexibility to pay higher prices to attract needed power 
if the current price  control regime is maintained  it will discourage sales from the southwest to the northwest this winter  because transmission costs will drive the cost of those sales above ferc  s price cap  mr  tabors said 
california wants caps to stay
officials representing california and its financially beleaguered utilities urged the commission to maintain the price  control order and to extend it beyond its october  expiration date to prevent a recurrence of last year  s power  market meltdown 
the price  control regime should remain in place at least until california  s utilities return to the market as creditworthy buyers  said fong wan of pg  e corp   pcg  and bill julian of the california public utilities commission 
a   markup allowed to compensate for credit risks for sales into california should be dropped  because the california department of water resources  a creditworthy buyer  is purchasing electricity on behalf of the utilities  they said 
ferc  s price  mitigation order  has been very successful   said gary stern of edison international  eix  unit southern california edison co 
prices stabilized shortly after the controls took effect and have been capped at   per megawatt  hour since late june  the last time the california independent system operator  the state  s grid manager  called an alert  conservation  mild weather and california  s entry into billions of dollars in long  term power contracts have kept market prices well below that cap for the most part 
ferc  however  is considering changing the pricing order to reflect the different needs of western utilities outside california  the commission is mulling whether power prices should change at times other than when california declares an emergency  perhaps to reflect fluctuations in natural gas prices 
ferc also is pondering changes to the requirement that generators make all uncommitted power available to california at all times  ferc staff asked whether the so  called must  sell requirement should apply only during emergencies and whether the mandate should be balanced by a  must  pay  requirement 
generators have complained that the state still hasn  t paid for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of power delivered since the department of water resources took over the job of purchasing power for customers of california  s largest utilities 
california focus challenged
absent withdrawal of ferc  s price  mitigation order  mr  tabors and other conference participants argued for changes in the order to better account for the predominance of hydropower generation in the northwest 
setting prices throughout the west based on prices in california  which gets most of its power from natural gas  fired generating plants  runs the risk of supply shortages in the northwest this winter  they said 
utilities operating hydropower facilities won  t know how much generating capacity they  ll have for next year until february  when a reliable assessment of snowpack will be available  given the uncertainty  hydropower operators will be reluctant to release water for generation this winter 
 shortages can happen this winter   said mike naeve  an attorney with skadden arps meaghre  flom representing portland general electric co   a unit of enron corp   ene    prices based on natural gas may not be sufficient to release hydro you may need next year  
under the current regime  the california independent system operator  controlled by appointees of gov  gray davis  could  manipulate the market by controlling exports to the northwest   said alan comnes of enron power marketing inc   ene    the current price mitigation is sowing the seeds for another crisis  
ferc  s pricing order has already been costly  said mark tallman of scottish power  s pacificorp  spi   if there is an arctic cold snap in the region this winter  price caps set by the california iso may be insufficient to assure enough supply  he said 
ferc should allow prices to rise to   per megawatt  hour price cap in the northwest if capacity margins drop to emergency levels  mr  tallman said 
mr  tabors and the enron officials recommended ferc adopt a     per megawatt  hour  circuit breaker  cap  such as exists in iso  administered markets in texas and the northeast 
ferc  s pricing order also was criticized for failing to account for the economics of  peaker  generating units  which only run during periods of peak demand  when prices typically spike
