summary of ferc  s
order establishing prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for the california wholesale electric markets and establishing an investigation of public utility rates in wholesale western energy markets
 issued april    
effective date   price mitigation is effective may      iso needs to have its day  ahead proxy price ready on    
physical withholding   to prevent physical withholding  the plan will require sellers with pga  s to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade  all california generators  even those not subject to ferc price regulation  will be required to sell into the iso  s real time market as a condition of their use of the iso  s interstate transmission lines  hydroelectric facilities will be exempted   this requirement to provide power is for all hours      for lyr 
price mitigation  the plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market  during stage    and  emergencies in the iso  s real time market  each generator  other than hydro  with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator  s heat curve  emission rates  gas costs and emission costs  plus    mwh for o emissions are to be based on cantor fitzgerald environmental brokerage services  the iso will publish by    am  the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared  these figures  for the next day  will be based on the prior day  s gas daily and cantor fitzgerald data  a single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators  highest bid sets the clearing price  each gas  fired generator must file with ferc and the iso within  days  on a confidential basis  heat and emission rates for each generating unit  the iso will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator  including maintenance and operating costs  generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability   although the following qualification is made   however  all public utility rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on market  based rates  discussed infra   presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior   in the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price  the generator must  within  days of the end of each month  file a report with ferc and the iso justifying its price  ferc explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the  all delivery point  index it has adopted  ferc has  days to review  act  no opportunity costs in real time  marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost 
underscheduling penalites   ferc acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place  thus  although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in r  t at capped prices  doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective    mwh penalty  see p   of the ferc order 
new generation   new generation is not exempted from the commission  s price mitigation measures 
demand response   beginning june   only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids  ferc is attempting to make the demand curve more price responsive   this requirement is in effect for all hours      
outages   pga generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages the iso is required to make a tariff filing within  days of the order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages  including periodic reports to the commission 
term  order expires one year from date of issuance 
rto filing  california iso and two utilities must make rto filing by june  or order lapses with no further effect  the rto filing is to be consistent with the characteristics and functions in order no   
iso reporting  on september     iso must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built  comments are due in  days  quarterly reports thereafter 
revocation of market based rate authority and refunds  the market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on    no physical withhold of capacity  and    no inappropriate bidding behavior  inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior  an increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate  in addition   hockey stick  bids are expressly prohibited  i  e  bidding   at marginal cost and   at a much higher level   other prohibited bidding practices identified include  pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs 
west  wide section  investigation  opens a section  investigation concerning the j  r of wholesale power in the wscc other than sales to the caiso market  ferc requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation  however its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real time  markets for power less than  hours in advance of r  t  spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below   within a control area  ferc is attempting to mirror the rules applied in california  comments are due in  days on the  investigations  although it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the non  california pnw  the ferc sets the refund effective date is  days from publication of the order 
nox limits in california   must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law  however  it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement  just include the fines as part of the price bid  also if nox is limited  may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price 
surcharge to pay past amount due   comments are due in  days on    whether ferc should require the iso to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and    the effect this surcharge would have on the pg  e bankruptcy filing 
treatment of the caiso  s market stabilization plan  msp   the ferc rejects the caiso  s msp saying that ferc  s plan for market mitigation is sufficient  it expressly rejects caiso  s plan to create a day  ahead and hour  ahead energy markets are expressly reject and tells caiso to stop actions to implement software changes to effectuate such markets  unfortunately  it does not expressly reject caiso  s plan to cut exports  in general  no mention was made as to issue of exports of power from california although the statement that caiso must become a real rto would support the notion that caiso must honor firm schedules on its system
