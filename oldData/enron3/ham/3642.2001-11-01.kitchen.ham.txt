new york  afx   enron corp shares were sharply lower  down more than  pct at midsession  as investors continued to fear that the company  s dealings with the ljm partnership could bring heavy financial reprisals following the opening of a formal inquiry by the securities and exchange commission  dealers said 
at    am  enron was down    usd  or    pct  to    
the djia rose    points to       the s  p  gained    points to      points  the nasdaq composite climbed    points to      
yesterday  enron announced the election of william powers jr to the board  to chair a special committee that will examine and take any appropriate actions with respect to transactions between enron and entities connected to related parties 
in addition to reviewing the transactions in question  the special committee is charged with communicating with the sec and recommending any other actions it deems appropriate 
while the investigation might take time to draw a conclusion  the immediate cash crunch enron has been facing is expected to be resolved  said merrill lynch analyst duane grubert 
one step in that direction came following enron  s announcement that jp morgan and salomon smith barney inc have executed commitment letters to provide  bln usd in secured credit lines supported by the company  s northern natural gas and transwestern pipeline assets 
over time  enron has several other options to raise cash  including cutting its  mln usd per year dividend  cutting back on its  mln usd of capital spending  and monetizing its july  right to convert debt into    million shares of eog  said grubert 
the danger for the company now is that a  real or fabricated confidence crisis by enron  s counterparties threatens near term strength of the merchant segment  competitors could get mean  and could prematurely shun enron  while trying to steal market share   he said

new york  nov   reuters   merrill lynch on thursday said it lowered both its mid  term and long  term ratings for enron corp   the no   buyer and seller of natural gas  to  neutral   from  accumulate  and  buy   respectively  due to uncertainty about the u  s  securities and exchange commission  s investigation into the company  s financial dealings 
analyst donato eassey said in a research note that while he  has not altered his view of enron  s fundamentals or its ability to weather the long term storm   he believes the noise surrounding the sec  s investigation will overpower any earnings analysis 
 ultimate outcome and underlying fundamentals aside  we believe significant pressure and uncertainty will remain on enron until the investigation concludes   eassey said 
the houston  based company  whose stock has been sent into a tailspin by the probe  said on wednesday the informal inquiry by the sec had become a full  scale investigation of the company  s finances

houston   enron corp  said thursday it has secured commitments for an additional   billion in financing from units of j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup inc  as the embattled energy trader moves to supplement its credit facilities 
 this is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor confidence   said enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon   we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating  
enron has seen its stock price plummet in a selloff sparked by a loss of investor confidence in the company following big third  quarter write  downs and the disclosure of an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission  in morning trading on the new york stock exchange  enron  ene  shares were down      or    to      the stock has declined from a   week high of     
enron  s new financing is secured by its northern natural gas co  and transwestern pipeline co  assets 
the financing news comes a day after the sec elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into enron  s financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer  andrew fastow  a formal investigation involves the sec  s enforcement branch going to the five  member commission and obtaining formal subpoena power to pursue its inquiry 
enron last week disclosed that the sec had contacted the company as part of what it described as an informal inquiry into the fastow  related partnerships  at the time  enron said it welcomed the inquiry and that it would cooperate fully with the sec   a position the company has restated repeatedly since 
in turn  enron named william power a director and head of a four  member committee to look into the fastow  related transactions and other matters  power is dean of the university of texas school of law 
enron has consistently said its dealings with the fastow  connected partnerships were legal and properly disclosed to investors  according to enron filings with the sec  the company did deals involving billions of dollars of assets and enron stock with entities related to the fastow partnerships  internal partnership documents indicate that mr  fastow and possibly others made millions of dollars from the partnerships  mr  fastow  who was replaced as chief financial officer by mr  mcmahon last week  has consistently declined to be interviewed

houston  ap   troubled enron corp  said thursday it has secured   billion in new financing  using its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral  but its stock price took another dive after rising a day earlier on takeover speculation 
in afternoon trading thursday on the new york stock exchange  enron shares were down    percent  or     a share  at     
after dropping to a nine  year low on tuesday  shares of the nation  s largest natural gas and power marketer rose  percent wednesday amid speculation the houston  based company was a takeover candidate 
but after the stock market closed for the day  enron announced the securities and exchange commission had opened a formal investigation into possible conflicts of interest 
the sec is apparently looking into dealings enron had with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer  andrew fastow  who was forced out last month as investors fled because of questions about the arrangements 
on thursday  enron announced its investment bankers had arranged for   billion in fresh credit lines that it planned to use partly to refinance maturing debts 
 this is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor confidence   said jeffrey mcmahon  enron  s new chief financial officer   we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating  
late wednesday  enron said it created a special committee headed by university of texas law school dean william powers to respond to the sec investigation  powers also was elected to enron  s board of directors 
 i have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthrightly investors  questions and concerns   said enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l  lay   we will also make every appropriate public disclosure during the course of the sec  s investigation  
however  duane grubert  an analyst with sanford c  bernstein and co  in new york  said enron still has much to do to restore investor confidence 
 with  stock  values this low  you  ve got two camps of investors  guys that hate enron and guys that want to be cautiously attracted to enron   grubert said   it  s led to the trading range being irrationally low and shares being oversold  it  s not something the company wants  
enron  s stock has skidded since the company reported a   million third quarter loss just over two weeks ago  dragged down by a one  time charge of     billion attributed to various losses  some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by fastow  who was ousted last week 
earlier this week  moody  s investors service downgraded the company  s long  term debt and warned of possible further downgrades 
since reporting its disappointing third quarter  enron had been negotiating to establish new credit lines 
carol coale  an analyst with prudential securities inc  in houston  said wednesday  s stock price surge  after two weeks of selling  was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report on rumors of a possible takeover of enron 
others might have been buying figuring the stock had hit bottom  she said 
on tuesday  enron  s stock closed at      its lowest level since  
potential buyers include general electric  s ge capital unit  warren buffett  s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell  the journal said

 copyright  c    dow jones  company  inc  
new york   dow jones   word that enron corp   ene  had secured   billion in fresh funds thursday did little to soothe prices on the company  s outstanding debt securities 
similar to other companies like lucent technologies inc   lu  that have faced short  term liquidity issues this year  enron was forced to put up its assets in order to secure the financing  and the new bank facilities leapfrogged in front of other creditors like senior unsecured lenders 
the houston  based energy and trading company said in a statement thursday that the new financing is supported by enron  s northern natural gas company and transwestern pipeline company assets  jpmorgan and salomon smith barney were co  arrangers on the credit lines 
enron plans to use the proceeds to supplement short  term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations  the new   billion of secured credit lines with the more than   billion in cash currently on the balance sheet  will further solidify enron  s standing as the leading market maker in wholesale energy markets   kenneth lay  enron  s chairman and chief executive officer  said in the statement 
but the need to pledge assets to get the credit lines shows caution on the part of lenders that  s understandable given enron  s situation  said susan abbott  a managing director in corporate finance at moody  s investors service 
 it signals the fact that the people with the money are not confident enough to trust the general corporate creditworthiness of the entity they  re loaning money to   abbott said  still  by securing the   billion  enron avoided a negative signal that it couldn  t secure financing  she said 
moody  s lowered the company  s senior unsecured long  term debt rating monday to baa  from baal  the debt is rated triple  b  plus by standard joe  niedzielski  dowjones  com

enron gets   bln loan to boost cash  credit rating  update  
 adds possibility of additional loans in  th paragraph  
houston  nov    bloomberg    enron corp   the largest
energy trader  received a   billion loan from j  p  morgan chase 
co  and salomon smith barney inc  after agreeing to use the
company  s natural  gas pipelines as collateral 
proceeds will go for debt payments and to supplement enron  s
short  term cash reserves  assets of enron  s northern natural gas
co  and transwestern pipeline co  will secure the loan 
the financing comes a day after enron said the u  s 
securities and exchange commission is formally investigating
partnerships run by its former chief financial officer  using the
pipelines as collateral signals enron  s desperation to reassure
shareholders and trading partners that it is creditworthy 
investors said 
  its not reassuring  it  s worrisome    said donald coxe 
manager of the harris insight equity fund  which owns about   
enron shares    if they had to secure the loan  obviously the
lenders don  t think they can rely on enron  s financial
statements   
shares of enron fell      or    percent  to     in late
morning trading  earlier  they dropped to      before today 
the shares had fallen  percent this year 
enron  s shares fell  percent last month amid an sec inquiry
into partnerships headed by andrew fastow  enron  s former chief
financial officer  that cost   million and     billion in lost
shareholder equity  a formal sec investigation began yesterday 
  it seems until we know more about the sec investigation 
it  s going to be a difficult time for the stock    said tara
gately  an energy analyst at loomis sayles  co   which sold most
of its enron shares early last year 
pipeline as collateral
enron  based in houston  got its start as a gas  pipeline
company  in the past decade  chairman kenneth lay has transformed
the company into the biggest trader of electricity  natural gas 
forest products and other commodities  enron accounts for about a
quarter of u  s  power and natural gas trades 
northern natural gas  enron  s largest pipeline  has
approximately    miles of pipeline from the permian basin in
texas to the great lakes  transwestern pipeline spans about   
miles 
since the sec began its inquiry  concerns about shaky
finances have prevented enron from selling commercial paper  or
short  term ious  the financing is to   enhance market and investor
confidence    enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said
in a statement 
  we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet
and maintain our investment grade credit rating   mcmahon said 
enron can borrow another   million by bringing other banks
into the loan  spokeswoman karen denne said    we don  t have any
plans to do so at this point    she said 
credit rating

term credit rating to   baa    from   baal    two notches above
junk status  it also placed the company  s   p     rating for

selling the assets  enron might have to repay any difference

 c  copyright  asia pulse pte ltd 
new delhi  nov  asia pulse  financial institutions led by the industrial development bank of india  idbi  have failed to come up with a solution to the long payment dispute with united states energy company enron that has forced the closing of the us     billion dabhol power project 
top officials of idbi and icici met officials in the finance and power ministries here today but failed to come up with an  optimum  solution 
 we discussed enron  the discussions are continuing and we are examining various options   idbi chairman p p vora told reporters after meeting power secretary a k basu 
he said the fis  which have a total exposure of over rs  billion in the project  wanted to come up with a optimum solution but declined to give a time frame for it 
earlier in the day  vora met finance minister yashwant sinha to apprise him about the situation 
fis had decided to come up with a solution by oct  for the second phase of the    mw dabhol power company  dpc  
a settlement of the enron imbroglio  being played out since early this year  assumes importance in view of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee  s forthcoming visit to washington where he is likely to have wide ranging discussions with us president george bush 
enron was the biggest donor to bush  s presidential electoral campaign 
so far  tata power and bses ltd  were in the fray for buying enron  s stake in dpc 
although the companies showed reluctance to buy enron  s stake at the price spelled out by the us power giant  vora said the two companies are still in the fray

india  sci to inject more funds into greenfield shipping

fin  times info ltd  asia africa intel wire  business line  the hindu  copyright  c   kasturi  sons ltd  all rights res  d
new delhi  oct   after several rounds of discussions and consultations within its board and with the ministry of shipping  the shipping corporation of india  sci  has finally decided to pump in   million as additional investment in greenfield shipping company to part  fund the gap in project cost of   million for building an lng tanker for transporting gas to dabhol power company 
 the shipping ministry has given its in  principle approval to sci for investing an extra   million in greenfield which will be in the form of a loan to the company and not as extra equity  the additional investment by sci would not require clearance from the union cabinet   government sources told business line 
though the additional investment of   million is to be shared equally by the three promoters of greenfield in proportion to their equity holdings  this proposition has gone awry due to the fact that one of the promoters  enron  affiliate atlantic commercial inc with a  per cent stake  has clearly said no to putting its share of extra funds 
in fact  atlantic commercial inc  is understood to have expressed a desire to exit from greenfield by selling its equity worth   million and the swap cost of   million 
consequently  the extra investment of atlantic commercial inc of   million is being shared by the other two partners  sci and japan  s mitsui o  s  k  lines  apart from their own share of the additional cost in proportion to their equity holdings of  per cent and  per cent respectively 
so  sci will put in an additional   million comprising its share of   million and   million of atlantic commercial  s share  whereas  mol will pump  in an additional   million including its share of   million and   million of atlantic  s share 
the additional investment by the promoters of greenfield shipping company has become necessary after the bankers to the lng shipping deal led by anz investment bank had suspended disbursement of the last tranche of the project loan of   million  citing an event of default 
the additional investment made by sci and mol will take the form of a loan to greenfield which would enable the company to take possession of the lng tanker on the scheduled delivery date of november  
greenfield was formed for owning an operating a    cubic metre capacity tanker for transporting lng to enron  promoted dabhol power plant  the tanker is ready for delivery at the yard of mitsubishi  japan 
the promoters are negotiating with oman lng to deploy the lng tanker  lng laxmi  till the lng terminal of dabhol goes on stream

enron and the curse of drexel
commentary  energy trader  s friends dry up
by david callaway   cbs  marketwatch  com
last update     am et nov    
san francisco  cbs  mw    it was the master of its universe 
its employees were rich  young and ruthless  it treated its clients and rivals alike  with disdain  its leader counseled business tycoons and political powerbrokers alike  and when the bottom finally fell out  it didn  t have a friend in the world to save it 
wall street loves a success story  but it loves a success story gone wrong even more  such was the case for drexel burnham lambert  the junk bond empire of the  s  whose spiritual leader michael milken orchestrated one of the greatest financial shell games of all time before it collapsed in a heap of federal investigations  losses and the largest bankruptcy in wall street history 
for enron  the energy trading giant that has seen its shares lose more than two  thirds of their value this month amid questions about its financial transactions and its stability  the similarities are striking 
like drexel  enron set out to change an industry  like drexel  it succeeded  for a while  under the guidance of chairman ken lay  enron evolved from a backwater texas natural  gas pipeline company to become the nation  s largest energy merchant 
its enrononline business transformed the way energy trading was done and funneled hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions through the company in last two years  the aggressive trading philosophy geared to squeezing a profit at all costs made millionaires of many employees  while those who were not deemed worthy simply vanished from the trading rooms  no questions asked  enron was and is the dark star of the energy industry 
for his part  lay became an international corporate celebrity  advising president bush on his campaign and taking a lead role with vice president dick cheney on the administration  s controversial energy plan earlier this year 
but enron  s attempt to extend its dominance into the telecom industry and its secretive financial structure finally got the best of it  the unexplained resignation of its chief executive in august  the ouster of its chief financial officer last week and the company  s inability to prove its financial health have prompted investors to bail out of enron stock like jackrabbits escaping a brushfire 
now lay  co  are busy trying to raise cash from a skeptical wall street that is starting to admit it never understood the business in the first place  sound familiar    takeover speculation gave enron shares a boost wednesday  helping it end a   day losing streak  but it  s unlikely anyone is going to step into this mess before a securities and exchange commission investigation into its finances yields a few more answers 
for investors  a short  term rally beyond the jump wednesday is still possible now that all of the big mutual funds have dumped the shares  but at a closing price of      enron shares are more than a texas mile from their   week high of     last december 
for enron itself  it  s time to put its cards on the table with regulators and wall street  as the drexel saga showed  a strategy of defiance to the end only hastens the end
