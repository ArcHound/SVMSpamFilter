please let me know how much of the  insurance premium is being allocated to the approx    mm of hpl assets  this charge is effectively  a cost of capital  and should be re  allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at corp

this insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage  values are adjusted annually at renewal  the premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds  in the event that we discontinue premiums to north america for hlp  we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured  in the event of a significant divestiture  underwriters may consider a refund  however  the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to enron  s values as a whole  additionally  enron  s adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures 
at renewal        north america  s revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of enron  s overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of enron

in additon to the      property value for bammel lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for bammel gas storage of       requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with aep not enron and thus the  plan premium allocations of     on the bammel gas storage      value and     on the bammel lease value of      should not be needed 
jackie
please remove these amounts from the ena  hpl  plan

as discussed for the purposes of the  insurance budget  we will delete the bammel lease    property values of        we will advise the insurers effective this past june to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund  however  as respects asset divestitures  insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience  however  if we are successful in receiving a credit  we will refund the premium 
i will discuss with karen and brian the other remaining assets
