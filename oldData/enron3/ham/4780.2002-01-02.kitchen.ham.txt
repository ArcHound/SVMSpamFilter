the aep and bridgeline deals must be investigated  there is no way the estate can support a production environment  i will be reviewing the contracts to determine our obligations and possible alternatives

subject  integration test planning  coordination mtg summary
key planning assumptions
  jan  go live
  new co conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by jan   this assumes all major production data setup  users  rights  books  global data  is completed and tested on a per application basis  some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other 
  integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from eol to sap through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work  we will not be testing functional permutations  data conditions  validation or exceptions to any significant degree 
  each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing  we are operating from the premise that data  infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts 
  all systems will be physically split  even unify at this point  
  integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both estate and new co 
  we will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production 
  we will minimize the differentiation between new co and estate for conversion and test team purposes  there are two teams  conversion and integration test  each team will focus on both estate and new co  resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility 
  estate conversions must happen at the application level before new co conversion work can begin in earnest  estate conversion is on the critical path for new co 
key issues
  we will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first  then physical  if financial is the focus  delivery risk goes down dramatically  for now  we must plan on the worst case   physical and financial on jan  
  we need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support aep and bridgeline in estate  this means that we need a dev environment  and hw gap addressed  for unify  sitara  cpr  tagg  erms  conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we  re in synch 
  unify servers probably can  t be owned by new co while running a single license of unify 
  some systems are using  short name  instead of duns id as a key for counterparties from global  the global  tagg  erms  unify and sap reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks 
  we must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates  we must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading 
  we can only convert estate over the weekend due to aep  bridgeline considerations  the time window will be very small

let me know if you have questions or changes  i am out tomorrow but i  m back on friday 
thanks
