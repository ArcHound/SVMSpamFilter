john and louise 
based on your meeting with kevin and dave earlier today  i understand you would like a breakdown of the expenditures expected to develop a texas coal plant to the point that it can be monetized 
the below is my best estimate for developing the brownsville site to get to the monetization point  permits in hand and epc contract signed   i expect to have both an epc contract and permits in hand some time around sep   if we start with the expenditures in mid july    expenditures will be incurred at the rate of approximately     per month for the next  months  we can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed 
costs for a florida site will be similar  however  expenditures will not start until we achieve site control 
my recommendation is to start fully developing the brownsville  tx site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit  as market conditions warrant  i recommend holding off on significant expenditures in florida until we get more comfortable with site control
