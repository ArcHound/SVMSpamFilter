subject  rri  analysis of orion power acquisition  maintaining
belowconse nsus estimates  reducing target price

good morning 
attached  please find our fc note on reliant resources 
summary 
  on september     rri announced it would acquire orion power
for     in an all  cash transaction 
   in our view this deal has very positive implications for
the sector  the purchase price is essentially in  line with our estimate of
the private market value of orn  s asset portfolio        overall  the
deal gives us addition confidence in our valuation framework and reinforces
our view that valuations in the sector are extremely attractive 
   rri is leaving unchanged its  eps guidance of
          in doing so  rri noted that the earnings contribution from
this deal        will offset the negative impact of sluggish conditions in
the western power markets 
   our  and  eps estimates remain unchanged at    
and      our  estimate continues to be below company guidance  giving
us comfort in our forecast 
   importantly  for  rri  s western generation assets are
currently less than   hedged  which is well below the company  s peers
including cpn  strong buy       and mir  buy        as such  the
company is relatively more exposed to commodity price volatility in that
region of the country 
  we are reducing our target price to   from    we derive this
valuation from our discounted cash flow  dcf  analysis  which employs an
    discount rate  our revised target price reflects    the     billion
acquisition expenditure    the     billion of assumed net debt    the
incremental earnings and synergies associated with the deal  and    the
earnings shortfall at rri  s western operations and slower overall growth
prospects for the business
