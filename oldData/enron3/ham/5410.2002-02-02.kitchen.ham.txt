subject  contracts listing
attached is a list of company legal names  with enron contract types identified  which some of the recipients of this email have requested 
the groups represented on this list roughly correspond to the groups on the various lists in circulation and should be relevant for relaunch 
the list i sent out earlier today contained some company names which had been identified by commercial groups as top   but in fact will not be trading on day  as they do not trade the products which we are planning to launch on day  
accordingly  we will send out a new list tomorrow morning  which will contain 
 names of pipelines or transmission companies needed for day 
 names of canadian companies needed for day 
the revised list will show only those names incremental to the  louise approved  list currently being used by credit and will contain the full legal name of the relevant entities 
to avoid any confusion  i suggest you delete the last list i sent you and use the  louise approved  list along with tomorrow  s list 
if anyone has any questions  please contact me on 
office    
cell    
thanks 
dave
