happy to get together on monday to give you all detail  yes  you are right  there is no such thing as schedule c or deferred account  it is cash  the   mm cash in schedule c is due back to tbg in january  anyway  even if we do not restructure the deal to our favor  the additional   k is cash contributed by office of the chair  john l   in december of  to settle december  and jan  with tbg  when john gave his approval to complete this settlement  he asked that i attempt to defer lump sum payment to december   i moved that out to december   i will get on you calendar on monday
