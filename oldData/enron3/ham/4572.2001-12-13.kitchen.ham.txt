nancy   as per our conversation this evening  i am attaching the e  mail i had sent to leslie hansen  i will contact leslie in the morning and determine what marks  domain names enron will allow for inclusion in the deal  i agree that if the new company is going to have a different name  it should be sufficient if enron kept the enrononline marks  domain names  but allowed their use for certain period of time to the new company  i also acknowledge your concern that granting use of the marks may be more complicated if they are owned by enron europe given that it  s a separate entity  we will need to work out this issue depending on which entity owns the marks  i will work with leslie to research this tomorrow 
with regard to the  nice to have  trademarks in the second list below  i know that most of the domain names are owned by enron europe  not enron corp  i will research to see which entity owns the trademarks on them  if the trademarks are owned by enron europe as well  we may forgo including them in the deal for now 
please hold off any offers for trademarks  domain names your deal papers until i call to confirm our final position  i plan to speak to leslie and dave forster  head of enrononline  in the morning  thanks
