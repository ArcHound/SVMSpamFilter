Subject re  netco employment agreements   version  of cover memo
attached is version  of the cover memo  as redlined from prior version  your comments and suggestions are appreciated  john  i rearranged your second paragraph  because i didn  t want our ability to disclose the agreement to potential counterparties to be limited by our satisfying the conditions outlined below  i hope that works 
if you need to reach me  i am at home at       or on my cell at      
thanks for your thoughts and comments
