Subject residual values  cogentrix
louise 
i spoke with victor yesterday and he said that the numbers we saw in our cogentrix meeting reflect our standard qf valuation methodology including a residual value of   kw  grown at     until the end of the contracted period  i had him do a sensitivity analysis by dropping the value to   kw and it only had a   million impact 
let me know if you have any additional thoughts
