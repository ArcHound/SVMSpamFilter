hi dave  kal
looks like we can use the ubswenergy  com domain name for a few months
then integrate you guys into the ubswarburg policies over time  can
you send back an email confirming that this works for you  i think
this is the best compromise we can reach for the moment which allows us
to not waste any more time in discussions 
thx
ursula

following our conversation this morning i just want to confirm what we
have agreed 
pat  please can you read through the points below and send stuart an
e  mail confirming that you agree with everything  particularly the
 conditions  section  and that all the ubs warburg energy staff will
comply with the conditions as laid out below 
decisions 
      
  the brand name for the new trading entity that we are acquiring from
enron will be ubs warburg energy 
  the domain name will be www  ubswenergy  com and we will also point 
but not market  various other domain names to the site  eg
www  ubsenergy  com  www  ubswarburgenergy  com
  the new entity will follow all ubs warburg corporate identity rules
in terms of font  imagery and colour usage for all printed and online
material 
conditions 
       
  that in  months  time  week beginning  july   our position is
reviewed  if this venture is successful and we plan to continue with
it  the branding position will change and the entity will be fully
incorporated into ubs warburg and any changes necessary with regard to
branding will be made 
  the domain name will change  will follow corporate guidelines and
will follow the format of www  ubswarburg  com  energy  where the
  energy  part can be discussed in order to ensure the most appropriate
name is used 
  all printed material will be changed to reflect the change in brand
which therefore means that any material produced immediately will have
a relatively short shelf  life as it may have to be re  printed
