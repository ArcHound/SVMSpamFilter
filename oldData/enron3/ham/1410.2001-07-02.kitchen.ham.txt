your intent for the conference calls was right  we need to have a dialog with these parties like we do with the rest of our structured suppliers  but it must be a coordinated effort  there was no need to cancel the calls  please coordinate to reestablish the conference calls with these contacts and for any others you may have  please contact the following people as they are directly responsible for customer coverage and structured supply in their respective regions  we appreciate your efforts and like comed and aep  i am sure we will continue to work closely
