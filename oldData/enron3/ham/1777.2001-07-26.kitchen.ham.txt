klog from our electrical equipment analyst
ssb electrical equipment analyst power supply  demand outlook
 jeff sprague  ssb  s electrical equipment analyst  has an interesting
perspective on the supply  demand balance for power  his forecast is based
on ge  s order book for turbines  which we think is an excellent source of
info 
 jeff points out that no orders have been canceled so far 
 although there are slight differences in our estimations of new
plant builds  his is higher  and reserve margin  his is higher   we think
this info  supports our view  on the margin  new plant builds exceed
demand  and reduce the tightness in the market  as measured by reserve
margins  we think there will be downward pressure on power prices and spark
spreads in this environment 
i  ve also attached jeff  s comments below  which he sent to his clients 
vis  a  vis the electrical equipment sector and ge in particular  as well as
our recent pc  report  for reference  any questions  please call   ray
 
jeff  s sprague  s        comments 
ge stock has been weak in recent days as concerns about lower power prices
have hurt utility stocks and raised the fear that power capacity is being
overbuilt 
ultimately enough capacity will be deployed in the us  but we do not believe
we are there yet  based on our analysis of ge  s delivery plans  the us will
reach a   reserve margin  based on capability at summer peak load  in
 
we do not expect the industry to ever return to the    reserve margins of
yesteryear  but   seems far from excessive given the very severe
shortcomings of the electrical grid  see our    report on the grid  
if ge  s output in   is flat with    reserve margins would rise to a
still reasonable    ge has filled     of its backlog for  and has
experienced no cancellations or push  outs in orders to date 
the bottom line is we believe the sell  off in ge is overdone  we will
publish a more detailed report on the supply demand equation in the u  s 
power market in the coming days  please see the attached spreadsheet for a
more detailed analysis
