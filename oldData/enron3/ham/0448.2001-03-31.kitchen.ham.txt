my responses 
  the carrying costs have been capitalized  and under the accounting rules will continue to be capitalized through the last payment date under the turbine contract 
  at this time  the turbine value is undetermined  while we have identified one potential counterparty  montana power   we do not have a signed deal  in addition  we are in the middle of a contract dispute with westinghouse regarding the damaged generator  while we hope to resolve this dispute in the context of our exiting the turbine position  there exists the potential of this going into litigation 
  janet and i proposed the deal i discussed with you to calme in december  but never got a formal response  i have put in several calls to elio tortolero at calme  but have not heard from him for about a month  he advised me at that time that he would get me a counter proposal  my group has had de facto management responsibility for the unit since december 
  this unit was initially an ena unit  but was taken by calme  david haug  i believe in december   for projects they were considering  i am not aware of the terms of that transfer 
fyi  i have attached a payment schedule for the turbine 
please let me know if you have any other questions  also  i have attached an updated site bank map which includes our texas site which was inadvertently left off the previous e  mail

i need to know two things     have the carrying costs been expensed through jan   and    is there commercial value to the turbine  if there is value to the turbine  then i really don  t understand allocating costs to a business unit that doesn  t own the turbine in order to create the illusion of a profitable transaction  i also need to know on what basis and against what agreement calme agreed to bear the carrying costs  the project it supposedly related to has been dead for several years
