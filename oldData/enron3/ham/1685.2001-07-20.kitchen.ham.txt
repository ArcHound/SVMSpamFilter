 paul 

 thanks for your email 

 i sent various emails since i did not know who should be contacted given
the
 various changes in the enron organization 

 the project is progressing  apel was wondering whether enron would have
an
 interest in marketing the output of the    mw plant and the low sulfur
 diesel under a long term contract at a fixed price 

 paul  could you email me your telephone number and address  we will keep
 you posted on progress 

 regards
