sec inquiry

investigation has become more serious 
investors say they are worried about     billion in

the sec inquiry into the partnerships he ran that cost the company
at least   million

  thailand is our favorite destination because we believe
political risk there is almost zero    said epdc  s takaraya 
  still  it  s a little bit dangerous to concentrate our
portfolio in one country    the next acquisition may be a stake in
a gas  fired power plant in the philippines  he said 
epdc  s overseas campaign demonstrates japan  s change in
policy  the company was set up in  to build hydro and coal 
fired power stations to reduce dependence on oil  fired power and
help meet increasing demand from industrial growth  its 
hydropower plants and eight thermal stations are able to generate

enron default insurance signals eroding confidence  update  
 adds background in  th paragraph  
new york  oct    bloomberg    the price that investors pay
to protect against a bond default by enron corp  doubled this
week  reflecting on erosion of confidence in the biggest energy
trader  the shares plunged for a  th day 
to hedge against losses for the next  months  investors now
have to pay as much as    percent of the face value of bonds
they own  a week ago  such insurance cost    percent  according
to creditsights inc 
enron   made a lot of people nervous and the concern is the
nervousness will seep into enron  s operating business    said
austin ramzy  director of fixed income research at principal
capital income investors in des moines  iowa  which owns about
  million in enron bonds    the question of the day is whether
the crisis of confidence can be stopped   
the increase in the price of so  called default swaps is
another reflection  along with a  percent decline in enron
shares in the past two weeks  that investors are losing confidence
in the company  analysts said 
enron shares  down  percent today to      have fallen
every day since the company surprised investors by writing off
    billion of assets on oct   
enron  s    percent coupon bonds due in  were bid at 
cents on the dollar  traders said  down as much as  cents from
yesterday  s price of  cents  the debt now yields    percent 
up from    percent yesterday and    percent on friday 
exposure
  banks wanting to hedge risk are pushing the price higher   
said andy palmer  who doesn  t own enron bonds in the     billion
he helps manage at asb capital management inc 
enron default protection has risen from less than  percent
per year  a price that is common for similarly rated companies 
other energy traders  such as williams cos  inc  and dynegy inc 
both have default insurance premiums below  percent per year 
traders said 
the increase in enron  s credit default swaps   may be
overstating the default risk    said palmer  the purchasers of the
default swaps are mainly banks that have loan exposure to enron
and   banks are not as price  sensitive as institutional
investors    said palmer    they just want to get the exposure off
their books   
principal capital  which is an institutional investor  said
did not buy protection for its   million of enron bonds 
john tompkins  a trader at credittrade  a credit derivatives
brokerage  said there  s interest among buyers  though not sellers
of enron default swaps  he said there are bids for enron credit
default swaps at  to  percent annually for five years 
protection and  percent annually on the three years  contract  
with no offers 
enron credit was one of the world  s biggest non  bank traders
of default insurance 
undisclosed
the largest energy trader  s troubles began two weeks ago when
it reported     billion in losses  including more than  
million written off on a competitive energy supplier business and
a bandwidth trading business 
enron formed at least  affiliated companies to buy and sell
company assets  according to records from the texas secretary of
state  some of those affiliates profited after enron used    
billion of company stock to buy back assets from the partnership 
the houston  based company losses included   million from
partnerships set up by chief financial officer andrew fastow 
fastow was later fired as chief financial officer and the u  s 
securities and exchange commission has asked for information about
the transactions 
the disclosure has set off concern among investors about how
little is known about enron  s balance sheet and caused ratings
companies to examine the company 
  investors are nervous about this name    said freda lam  a
fixed  income analyst at j  p  morgan chase  co  in new york 
investor relations
enron  s long  term debt rating was cut yesterday to   baa    
two levels above junk  from   baal    moody  s also placed the
houston  based company  s   p     rating for commercial paper  
borrowing for nine  months or less   on review for downgrade 
enron has been shut off from the commercial paper market since the
ratings agencies began the review 
the lack of access to money markets makes it more difficult
for enron to borrow the short  term cash needed to run its trading
businesses  ahead of a potential cut  enron took out bank lines to
repay   billion in commercial paper last week 
still  many on wall street expects enron  s bonds to be paid
and its stock price to bounce back 
  we suspect that enron  s share price will not likely recover
in the near term    lam said    we ultimately expect this company
to be successful  but it needs to improve its investor relations
and its disclosure

enron chairman weathers a storm  many in houston believe lay can get
firm back on track  business

dallas morning news  l  p 
houston  over the last  years  enron corp  has transformed itself
from a sleepy gas pipeline company into an energy trading giant 
chairman ken lay has changed along with it  from mere titan of
business to houston  s leading citizen 
so when business reversals hit enron and mr  lay  the ripples are felt
throughout civic life in a city where he has held virtually every
leadership position and the corporate name graces the baseball stadium 
two months after his heir apparent resigned  mr  lay has seen his
company buffeted by investors and has had to oust his chief financial
officer 
the securities and exchange commission is looking into deals in which
the former cfo played dual roles with enron and a hedge group 
 my sense is it  s probably a little too soon to tell what the impact
is with ken himself   said bob eury  president of central houston inc  
a downtown development group 
a loss of his and enron  s leadership  would be profound   mr  eury
added  but most houstonians expect mr  lay to weather the company  s
difficulties and continue his  marvelous leadership out in the
community  
still  no one is going to be surprised if mr  lay is preoccupied for a
while 
 if the ship  s on fire  you address that first   said oilman george
strake  who has worked with mr  lay on civic projects 
mr  lay    returned to the chief executive  s role in august when his
protege  jeffrey k  skilling  quit as ceo and president after only six
months on the job  and mr  lay cited those burdens last week when he
resigned as a director for i  technologies  the software developer based
in farmers branch 
 this is a very painful decision   mr  lay said in a prepared
statement   but now that i am again taking on the ceo responsibilities
at enron  i must reduce my outside activities  
enron  s fall has been hard 
from a   week peak of     on dec    the stock has been tumbling
for months  it skidded all the way to     as of friday  s close  about
half its value just two weeks earlier 
profits remain strong  but the company has announced write  downs of
key assets  totaling     billion in after  tax nonrecurring expenses 
and wall street analysts have turned coldly skeptical  if not hostile 
mounting troubles
enron confirmed the securities and exchange commission inquiry into
deals involving the just  departed cfo  andrew fastow  under pressure 
enron replaced him wednesday 
there have been other troubles  too  as lead advocate for electricity
market restructuring  enron found itself under furious attack during
california  s energy crisis last spring  investments in communications
and water businesses soured  a huge power plant project in india has
become a problem 
mr  lay has said all the concern is misplaced 
 to say the least  we are    disappointed with our stock price   he
told investors last week  but  our businesses are performing very well 
and we  re continuing to conduct business as usual  
as for the sec  s interest   we welcome    the opportunity it provides
us to put these matters to rest   he said 
skepticism that mr  lay can pull enron back into the middle of the
road exists in houston 
but the doubters don  t want to be quoted by name and are not
necessarily betting against him  considering his past successes 
in houston   nobody  s dancing on his grave   said lawyer david berg 
who  s active in civic and political affairs   there  s a lot of residual
respect for ken lay  and it  s not going to go away even if he goes
bankrupt  but that isn  t going to happen  
wall street reaction
financier charles miller  a wall street veteran  said analysts appear
to be ganging up on enron  with a few making  indefensible  comments
that might be criminal if made about a bank 
 wall street may be envious of the fact that  from the trading
standpoint  he may have made one of the most profitable trading
operations in the history of the world and  from all i can tell  very
soundly   mr  miller said 
from wall street comes a different interpretation  after the exit of
two top executives in two months  the company  s other problems  and the
sec  s inquiry  it  s time for more information from the company 
 they  ve breached the confidence level with one thing after another

the  s oil  banking  and real estate busts have colored houston  s
attitude toward business reversals  some say 
having seen fortunes rise  fall  and rise again in the   s  houston
is less likely to lose leaders to temporary setbacks  energy banker
matthew simmons said 
 most cities  if you  re new or if you  re struggling  you  re shut out  
mr  simmons said  not houston  and  i think that  s its genius  
real estate investor ned holmes recalled that when exxon corp 
suffered through the  alaska oil spill  the chamber of commerce
threw a reception to express support and appreciation for the company  s
civic contributions 
 we all turned out and told them that    we know this is a difficult
deal  but they  re an important part of this community and we  re not
turning our back on them   mr  holmes said   people feel every bit as
strongly  if not more so  about ken  
it  s hard to overstate the importance of mr  lay and enron in houston 
he chaired or co  chaired committees leading houston in playing host to
the g   summit in  and the republican national convention in  
he chaired the university of houston board of regents 
when plans for a new baseball stadium hit a snag in the mid   s  he
assembled a group of investors to buy the land and facilitate a deal
that led to voter approval  enron then bought the naming rights to the
astros  new home  enron field

arena  now under construction  he has backed rail transit and other
measures to clean houston  s air

new model
in reinventing itself into a   billion  a  year energy trader  enron
created a business model that other energy companies have followed 
making houston a leader in a new kind of commodities market 
enron  whose influence extends into the white house of president bush 
is in the midst of adding to houston  s skyline  building a   story
building next door to the   story building it already occupies 
losing mr  lay  s and enron  s leadership  would be a sizable blow  
said jim kollaer  president of the greater houston partnership  a
business  boosting group that includes the chamber of commerce  but  he
hasn  t pulled back  
 he has to be there to answer these questions  he  s going to take time
to do that   mr  kollaer said   but he  s still functioning in a civic
regard
