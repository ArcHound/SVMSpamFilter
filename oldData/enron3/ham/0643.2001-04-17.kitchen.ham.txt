i am meeting with scott josey on thursday regarding crescendo  i am going to propose to him that all of crescendo goes into ecr and he reimburses upstream products for incurred capital charges for   since ecr is utilizing nick cocavessis  s technical services organization for all infrastructure needs and he reports to brian redmond  upstream products would not be charging ecr a fee  the technical services organization is commercial support for enron americas 
i have spoken to brian and he is fine with my proposal  in addition  josey and i have had a brief conversation and on thursday  i expect to be negotiating details

bearing in mind this      split  how about we put it all in ecr and then you charge them a fee for all work you do on it
