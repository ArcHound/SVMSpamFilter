ok  i know that 
i wasn  t planning to  promote  all the managers to director however  just retitle them  leave their salaries as is  if we want to give them all bumps to    from     then i  ll start water dropping that 
i was assuming you wanted  or  new md  s   or  new vp  s and probably  or  other incidental changes on the support side between specialists and snr directors  presuming we don  t do away with titles for support folks
