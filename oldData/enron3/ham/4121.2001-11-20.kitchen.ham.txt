earliest is first week in december  but overall deal is at risk  they are having consent issues due to qf status  basically  this acquisition puts nrg  s interest up to    nsp owns   of nrg but has   of the voting shares  if you count the   ownership  nsp is below   and ok  if you consider the   then nsp is over   and the qf is bust 
our counsel  labeuf  didnot see a problem with this  but apparently they are the only firm that will give a good opinion  the bank  s counsel has set up an informal ferc meeting  if the ferc staffers nod approval  we can get it done  if not  we have a probem  our original solution to this potantial problem was to sell them the loan  but this looks a little difficult for nrg to swallow in light of our now infamous innovative financing structures
