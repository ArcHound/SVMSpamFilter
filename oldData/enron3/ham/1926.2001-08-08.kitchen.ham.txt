 dave is incredibly valuable to our business 
 he lives in the most expensive city in the country 
 he has made enron   mm  most of which could not have closed if he lived in houston or portland 
 he is sitting on  like the rest of us  a lot of out of the money calls 
i think the following is appropriate 
base       cola
signing   
equity
