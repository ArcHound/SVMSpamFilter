western energy   winter demand peaks not expected to result in price spikes or reliability problems
building natural gas and power supplies are providing a cushion for the western
energy markets for this winter  although seasonal gas and power demand spikes
will again push prices higher  this winter will not look like the winter of
    unlike during the record high gas and power prices and blackouts last
year winter  reduced demand  increased gas storage levels  and new gas and
power supplies will significantly temper prices and significantly reduce the
risk of supply disruptions 
 a supply build of  million cubic feet  mmcf  per day in the rockies and
 mmcf in western canada is meeting with declining demand in the west
 fourth quarter power demand is expected to be  percent below levels last
year  while over    megawatts of new supply has been added this year
 only severe cold weather  prolonged drought  or a supply disruption could
produce a reliability problem this winter
