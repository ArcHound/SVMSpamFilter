new york   dow jones   it  s been a brutal year in the risk arbitrage business  and that has many arbitrageurs  also known as takeover traders  steering clear of bets on dynergy inc   s  dyn  possible takeover of enron corp   ene  
some of their reluctance stems from the fact that the looming deal reported by dow jones newswires has yet to be confirmed by the two houston energy trading companies 
more worrisome  however  is the possibility that enron  already crippled by an equity probe and a restatement of four years of earnings  may have even deeper woes to report 
 unless enron is providing significantly more disclosure to the buyer than to the rest of the world  i don  t see how a buyer could get comfortable   said an arbitrageur with a new york hedge fund 
what worries takeover traders is the likelihood that any agreement would likely have extensive material adverse change  or mac  clauses  providing plenty of room for dynergy to exit the deal should more problems arise at enron 
 as an investor  it  s hard for me to own something when i don  t know what it is   said the arbitrageur of enron   i take some comfort that someone is stepping up the plate  but that  s not enough for me  
another arbitrageur added   if it gets announced  it  s a deal with a lot of issues  starting with who bears the risk if enron has a lot of lawsuits because of alleged accounting fraud  
according to the wall street journal  dynergy will swap nearly    of a share of its stock for each share of enron  also under the deal  chevrontexaco corp   cvx   which owns   of dynergy  will make an immediate cash injection of     billion into the deal  and then add another billion on closing 
shares of dynergy jumped more than   in heavy trading  bolstered by the idea that the company is picking up enron for a steal  its shares traded recently at      up     a share 
an acquirer  s shares typically fall after a deal has been announced  in part because arbitrageurs sell the shares short  while going long the target  in this case  however  arbitrageurs are largely on the sidelines  which is perhaps alleviating some of the downside pressure on dynergy 
enron  meanwhile  traded about   higher recently  swapping hands at     a share in heavy volume  the stock was buoyed by the reported bid from dynergy as well as a new credit rating from moody  s  the firm downgraded enron  s rating a notch to just above speculative  not as bad as the junk rating some had feared

 c  reuters limited  
new york  nov   reuters   enron corp   on the verge of a bailout by rival dynegy inc   on friday had its credit ratings cut to a notch above junk status and some energy traders became increasingly leery of dealing with the company 
moody  s investors service cut enron  s long  and short  term ratings  affecting about   billion in debt  and warned the company  s rating could be cut again to junk status on continued loss of investor confidence  impairing its ability to operate 
a significant amount of debt coming due in the near term  and the potential for increased margin requirements from its counterparties in wholesale trading operation also puts further pressure on enron  the ratings agency said 
 the company may not be able to retain investment  grade characteristics   moody  s said 
enron  s trading partners began to cast a more watchful eye on their relationship with their energy trading behemoth  which has seen almost   billion slashed from its market worth in the past month on mounting investor concerns 
 our people are definitely looking at our dealings with enron after the downgrade    we need to make sure our bills will be paid   one texas  based spot trader said  adding his company was still conducting business with enron 
the stock  which has plummeted  percent this year  moved into the black on friday after enron confirmed talks regarding the acquisition of enron by dynegy are continuing 
an announcement  which is expected later friday  is expected to include a     billion injection of capital for enron from chevrontexaco corp   the no   u  s  oil company  and    percent holder of dynegy 
shares of enron rose  cents  or    percent  to     in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange  and dynegy gained      or  percent  to      the stock was the most actively traded on the nyse 
restated results
in recent weeks enron  s stock has plunged amid investor unease about disclosures of off  balance sheet deals involving its former chief financial officer  the deals are now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission for possible conflict of interest 
 people just don  t want to deal with them anymore   said one trader  who heads the trading desk of one of the world  s largest oil companies 
on thursday  enron acknowledged it erred on past earnings reports and restated financial results going back to   the restated earnings cut net income by   million over the period  or  percent  and increased its debt by   million  pulling some of its partnerships onto the balance sheet 
enron also fired its treasurer and a general counsel of one of its divisions on thursday 
until now  enron  s trading operations appeared relatively sheltered from its financial troubles  especially in the daily markets contracts 
trading volumes on enrononline  the leading internet  based trading system for electricity  actually increased over the rolling   day period 
at the beginning of the week  enrononline dollar volumes averaged between     billion and     billion  compared with a   day rolling average of     billion  according to eric thode  a spokesman for enrononline 
the number of transactions posted on the site averaged over    on monday  well above the    average for the past  days 
trading under pressure
but friday  trading volume appeared to wane slightly  according to one industry watcher
 i  ve been watching the enron board all morning and it hardly lit up at all   said one trader in the u  s  northeast  the board lights up each time a transaction is made for delivery to a particular point 
the hardest hit of enron  s energy trading operations appear to be natural gas trades and both natural gas and electricity forward contracts  which are trades for delivery from one month to five years ahead 
 starting today we are no longer doing forward deals with enron on the gas side  we are still doing day  ahead deals though   one southeast dealer said 
he added he was unsure if his company was still trading forwards  or long  term deals  on the electricity side 
 people are becoming much more cautious about entering into long  term energy deals with enron  especially the one  to five  year delivery contract for gas or electricity   said one major midwestern power trader 
while many major traders watch online volumes and transactions  many bypass the system and make their deals over the telephone directly with enron 
earlier this week  major natural gas producer apache corp  said it unwound most of its natural gas hedges due to concerns about increasing risks in the energy derivatives market as a result of enron  s recent problems

new york  nov   reuters   stocks ticked higher in early afternoon trading on friday as investors took a positive view of the latest economic news  but profit warnings from household names like h  j  heinz  co  and the walt disney co  put a cap on their enthusiasm 
energy and oil services stocks helped carry the market higher  getting a boost after russia  s prime minister indicated russian companies will join the organization of exporting petroleum countries  the oil cartel  in cutting production to lift oil prices 
the market  s ability to make up virtually all of the losses it made in the wake of the sept   attacks on new york and washington has given investors courage  despite the dismal condition of corporate earnings  said said nat paull  portfolio manager at new amsterdam partners 
 the current profit profit picture  i think everybody knows  is pretty weak  but the focus is turning to   and that definitely is going to be a rebound year   paull added 
the market surged this week on a slew of interest  rate cuts in europe and the united states  but wall street is still torn over whether the moves are enough to patch up the bruised global economy  traders said 
the dow jones industrial average rose    points  or    percent  at       and the broader standard  poor  s  index edged up    points  or    percent  to      
the technology  laced nasdaq composite rose    points  or    percent  to      
stocks got a fleeting boost on news afghan that anti  taliban forces entered the northern city of mazar  i  sharif  marking an advance in the war against the group suspected of masterminding the sept   attacks on the united states 
oil stocks were higher  including amerada hess  which gained     to      and conoco inc   up     at     
the latest earnings news kept wall street  s tone subdued  however  after entertainment giant walt disney and food manufacturer heinz warned profits would likely be lower than expected 
disney  which said it was suffering from weak advertising and low ratings at its abc tv network and lower attendance at its theme parks  all worsened after sept    disney reversed an early loss and climbed  cents to     
heinz slumped     to     after cutting its earnings forecast  citing a slowdown in its food service business as a result of lower demand from restaurants 
traders said they expect volume to lighten after    p  m   gmt  when the bond market closes early in observance of the veteran  s day holiday on monday 
the nasdaq has surged this week following aggressive rate cuts by the european central bank  the bank of england and the u  s  federal reserve  the hope is that lower borrowing rates will prompt companies to spend and expand  in turn expanding global economies and corporate earnings 
but dismal corporate outlooks and mixed economic news stunted the market  s gain 
a report showing plunging u  s  wholesale prices weighed on stocks as investors began to question whether the drop will soon hurt earnings 
the producer price index had the sharpest drop on record in october as a slowing global economy sapped energy prices and american carmakers offered cut  rate financing to lure buyers into showrooms after sept   attacks 
 people may be worried about deflation   said james volk  co  director of institutional trading at d  a  davidson and co  in portland  oregon 
still  a consumer confidence indicator offered a bright note after sentiment strengthened in early november 
expectations and current conditions rose to    from    in october  according to the university of michigan  s index  analysts had forecast the index to fall to    
enron corp  was most active on the new york stock exchange for the  th session of the past  
the stock initially fell after moody  s investors service cut enron  s short  term and long  term rating because of a steep loss of investor confidence  then it rose  cents to     as news trickled out that rival dynegy inc  is close to taking over enron at about   a share

so  if you trusted and believed that a company in late october  just about three weeks ago  you would have lost  percent of your investment  just in the past three weeks  not going back to the   
and to be clear  we  re not picking on the company here  they made that initial statement knowing full well this was a huge controversy  the government was looking into it  investors were losing faith in management  still they said  we believe we did everything right  i think in that case it might have been better to say  we  re just looking into it 
marchini  why would dynegy want to risk exposing itself in fear that there might be still more to come 
viles  well  this new information about earnings  this restatement did not come from the company  it came from a special board that was brought in just to look at this  and the lawyer for that board was bill mclucas  ph   he used to be the chief enforcement officer from the sec  so  a certain amount of credibility in the new set of numbers  also the performance this year at enron is not terrible  the earnings i think  are at     per share  through three quarters  so  you  re looking at maybe     for the year  an   stock      in earnings  it  s really cheap  maybe there is a business here worth saving 
but it is clear that current management does not have a whole lot of credit  is they  re bottom fishing and they  re bottom fishing at a pretty cheap price  i mean it was a   stock when the controversy erupted  it has only gone lower and i guess they think there is some value here 
marchini  you know  moody  s downgraded it today  this is a business that is very heavily depend on looking good to counterparts  looking like its not much of a risk 
viles  yes  and that  s what  s gone wrong in the last three weeks  people have just said  geeze  there is just all kinds of stuff going on there  i don  t really understand it  the company hasn  t really explained it  i think i  ll stay away and just let the dust clear and see what happens when it does clear 
i think what dynegy is saying  they think they  ve seen enough to know that there is something left to the company  it has been premiere energy trading company in the united states  energy trading is decent business  dynegy knows that business  they would probably know better than bond investors and stock investors what is there and what  s of value 
marchini  at least their shareholders hope so  right 
viles  hope so

usa  enron faces lawsuits seeking class action status

 c  reuters limited  
new york  nov   reuters   troubled enron corp   under investigation by u  s  regulators and in talks to be acquired by a smaller rival  also must contend with a battery of lawyers smelling blood 
at least seven law firms have filed suits against enron and its principal officers on behalf of shareholders who bought the energy trading giant  s shares from jan     to oct    the stock has plummeted about  percent this year 
the lawsuits accuse the nation  s largest energy trader of overstating operating results  failing to write  down assets on a timely basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices and concealing investments that may require enron to issue large amounts of shares to cover losses 
houston  based enron declined to comment 
but on thursday enron restated financial statements from  to  and the first two quarters of this year  admitting it erred in reporting past results 
the company also on thursday fired its treasurer and the general counsel for one of its divisions  the latest executives to leave or be forced out of senior positions at enron 
the firms are actively seeking enron shareholders to join their lawsuits  which seek class action status  the suits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of texas in houston 
judge lee rosenthal is assigned to newby vs  enron corp   which seeks   million in damages  according to chief deputy clerk david bradley  the suit also named enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay  former ceo jeffrey skilling and former chief financial officer andrew fastow
skilling  a long  time enron executive  resigned in august as ceo after only six months in that position  fastow abruptly left the company last month 
disclosure at heart of suits
a scheduling conference is set for jan   and a judge will then determine if all the lawsuits should be consolidated and if the case should be certified as a class action lawsuit 
lawyer arthur stock of law firm berger  montague pc  one of the law firms filing a class  action suit  said the court would decide which firm would be lead attorney  a decision based on the firm that represents the largest shareholders 
since enron released earnings on oct    u  s  regulators have launched a probe into some enron transactions  its shares have fallen almost  percent and wiped off   billion in market capitalization  and ratings agencies have slashed its credit rating to near junk status 
enron posted charges of   billion in its third  quarter earnings  and announced the day after the earnings were released it would write down shareholder equity by     billion 
 we are quite sure the impact of enron  s off  balance  sheet investments were material and not adequately disclosed   said stock 
 we allege that enron  s investments in azurix and new power were overvalued at the end of   but enron wrote them down at the end of the third  quarter in   they knew or were reckless in failing to know  the information was available  
new york university law school professor marcel kahan  who specializes in securities law  said class  action lawsuits are usually lawyer  initiated  with lawyers calling shareholders rather than shareholders calling them 
but there is nothing wrong with this  said kahan  because  if we waited for the clients to move first we would have virtually no suits

 this does not mean that we have gone  or will go   soft  on securities violations or financial fraud   pitt said in a speech on thursday to securities lawyers in new york 
how pitt and the commission handle the enron case  in light of the guidelines and pitt  s other statements  will say a lot about the sec  s future course  lawyers said 
 it  s going to be a test of whether the commission will look carefully to make sure that the four steps were really met   langevoort said 
for its part  enron has ousted the chief financial officer who was instrumental in setting up two outside partnerships that were involved in the unusual transactions being probed 
the company on oct   appointed a special committee to investigate the affair  the committee hired the high  profile law firm of wilmer cutler  pickering and the accounting firm of deloitte  touche to assist it in its probe 
on thursday  enron fired two more executives and restated its financial results back to  
 the company has from the outset  and will continue to cooperate fully with the sec  we will also proceed with our own review of the transactions   said enron spokesman mark palmer 
while much remains to be seen  langevoort said enron  s action  seems to be a set of efforts that goes very much in the direction  of satisfying the sec  s guidelines

but he and other lawyers pointed out that the oct   guidelines on cooperation were issued in response to a case involving kansas food and shipping group seaboard corp   a much smaller company in a much smaller matter 
moreover  securities lawyers said  the first of the four tests  self  policing prior to discovery of misconduct  may be a difficult hurdle for enron to surmount 
 this is a serious case and the sec guidelines don  t provide the answer to it   said richard phillips  a partner at the law firm of kirkpatrick  lockhart in san francisco 
 self  policing prior to discovery  means consistent vigilance over company finances  securities lawyers said they found it difficult to imagine that enron senior executives were in the dark for four years on the unusual transactions 
 cover  up with respect to public companies is really headed for the trash bin  you can  t cover up anything   said stanley sporkin  a partner at weil gotshal and manges in washington who is a former u  s  district court judge and top sec official

india  enron  s dabhol suffers legal setback in indian row 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
bombay  nov   reuters   u  s  energy major enron corp  s indian unit  dabhol power company  dpc   on friday said a court had stopped it from pulling out of its beleaguered     billion power project until december  
the bombay high court  which on friday heard a petition against dabhol by a clutch of indian lenders to the project  prevented the company from issuing a final notice to terminate its contract with the maharashtra state electricity board  a dabhol official told reuters 
the court order is a blow to enron  which owns  percent of dabhol  general electric co and bechtel corp own  percent each  with the board holding the remaining  percent 
the u  s  energy giant  s attempts to exit the project by either selling its stake or terminating the contract has become more urgent in the face of its financial troubles at home 
the houston  based company has been plagued by investor doubts and is under the gun to shore up its crumbling finances 
the first phase of enron  s controversial indian project has been completed  but work on the second phase was abruptly stopped in june following a bitter dispute between enron and the local utility  the plant  s sole buyer 
the cash  strapped indian utility had in  contracted to buy all the power from dabhol  s    mw plant on the western coast of india  the country  s largest foreign direct investment 
but it later said it did not need all the power and that it was too costly 
while dabhol has said it would prefer to resolve its dispute with the board amicably  it felt the discussions with the power plant  s indian lenders and the government were not progressing 
in that case  it may be forced to terminate the contract  and file for damages in the international court of arbitration in london 
but the bombay high court has said it will hear the case again on december  
the case against dabhol was filed by indian lenders  led by the country  s largest term lender  the industrial development bank of india  as they want to salvage their loans to the power project 
they fear that if enron is unable to sell its stake and terminates its contract with the utility  it could end up defaulting on its loans 
which way out 
the dispute between dabhol and the indian utility came to a head in june  when enron decided it would stop work on the second phase of the project even though it was almost complete  after the board defaulted on payments 
the dispute  which has hurt india  s attempts to attract more foreign investment in the power sector  also cast a cloud over the loans advanced by indian banks and financial institutions  which have an exposure of  percent of the total project cost 
dabhol served a preliminary notice in may to terminate the project and can serve a final notice if a six  month cooling  off period fails to produce a solution 
that six month deadline ends on november  
analysts said there are only two ways for enron to pull out of the project  wait for the bombay high court to lift the stay on december   or hope that its stake is bought out by one of the two potential suitors  india  s tata power company ltd or bses ltd

staff reporter of the wall street journal
dynegy inc  is close to finalizing a deal to buy beleaguered enron corp  for about   billion in stock  according to people familiar with the matter 
the deal  which is likely to be announced friday  calls for houston  based dynegy to swap nearly    of a share for each share of its crosstown rival  these people said  based on current trading prices on the new york stock exchange  that would value enron at about     a share  enron shares traded at     at  p  m  thursday on the big board  meaning the dynegy deal amounts to a   premium 
terms call for chevrontexaco corp   cvx  to inject     billion into the deal immediately  and another   billion upon closing  other parties also may inject cash into the deal  although it was unclear if all those details had been finalized 
if approved by regulators  the deal would be a stunning development for enron  which transformed itself from a staid natural  gas  pipeline company into a highflying power  trading giant only to see its share price   and hefty market valuation   plummet in a matter of weeks  dynegy is one  fifth enron  s size 
enron  s stock price  which traded near   at the beginning of the year  has been pounded in the past three weeks  falling roughly    over concerns that serious financial problems weren  t being disclosed to shareholders  shares of enron  ene  fell  cents to     friday morning on the new york stock exchange  where dynegy  s  dyn  shares climbed     to     
enron has been scrambling for days to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private  equity firms and power  trading companies  the company desperately needs to win back its credibility on wall street following the disclosure that the securities and exchange commission was investigating partnerships enron created to serve as a hedge against fluctuating market conditions 
on thursday enron reduced its previously reported net income dating back to  by    mostly due to improperly accounting for the partnerships 
concerns over enron  s financial condition are vexing investors and analysts  including those at major credit  rating agencies  on friday  moody  s investors service lowered enron  s debt rating to one level above junk  bond status and said the company  s long  term debt ratings remain under review for further downgrade  late last month  fitch put enron on review for a possible downgrade  while another  standard  poor  s  changed enron  s credit outlook to negative from stable

new york  nov   reuters   ratings agency moody  s investors service on friday cut its long  and short  term ratings for embattled energy trader enron corp  and warned another cut is possible because a substantial loss of investor confidence had hurt the firm  s financial flexibility 
moody  s cut houston  based enron  s senior unsecured debt ratings to  baa    its lowest investment grade  from  baa    it also cut the company  s commercial paper rating to  not prime  from  prime    
if moody  s cuts enron  s long  term rating again  it would take it to a junk level  making it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day  to  day business  friday  s downgrade also adds uncertainty to a potential merger with rival dynegy inc   which has been in talks to acquire enron 
sources told reuters on thursday that dynegy  s board was waiting for word from major credit rating agencies to determine whether acquiring enron would result in a significant downgrade of its debt  dynegy has asked for an expedited review from moody  s and standard  poor  s on how the merger would affect its ratings 
seeking to calm fears that it faces a credit crunch  enron in late october said it had drawn on its committed lines of credit to provide more than   billion in cash liquidity 
despite that move  enron faces  significant debt maturities over the near term  as well as the potential for increased margin requirements from counterparties of its wholesale trading operation   moody  s said 
 the company may not be able to retain investment  grade characteristics   moody  s said 
enron  s stock and credit ratings have plunged since disclosures of off  balance  sheet deals now under investigation by the u  s  securities and exchange commission for possible conflict of interest 
the deals contributed to a   billion third  quarter charge and     billion reduction in shareholder equity 
on thursday  enron restated its financial statements since   trimming earnings from  to  by   million  or  percent  and increasing its debt by   million  or  percent 
s  p last week cut enron  s corporate credit rating to  bbb   two notches above junk  from  bbb  plus   and warned it may cut the ratings again

new york  afx   moody  s investors service said it downgraded the senior unsecured debt ratings of enron corp to baa  from baa  
enron  s long  term debt ratings remain under review for further downgrade  moody  s said the rating actions reflect enron  s  reduced financial flexibility as a result of a substantial loss of investor confidence  
enron drew down its bank credit facilities in order to shore up near  term liquidity  but faces significant debt maturities over the near term  as well as the potential for increased margin requirements from counterparties of its wholesale trading operation 
in addition  uncertainty surrounding the firm  s contingent obligations creates increased risk for debtholders  it said in a statement 
moody  s said that enron  s well  established wholesale trading franchise and its regulated pipeline businesses have solid operating attributes and generate good cash flow 
however  the rating agency concludes that the company may not be able to retain investment grade characteristics 
moody  s review will focus on enron  s ability to further improve its liquidity and capital position  the rating agency would view a substantial near term injection of equity capital as a stabilizing event

enron shares were off  cents to     on the instinet electronic brokerage  there were no trades in dynegy 
the two companies on thursday confirmed they were discussing a possible  business combination   but they had not yet reached agreement on a deal said by sources to involve a stock swap worth   billion  or   a share  and a     billion capital infusion by major dynegy stakeholder chevrontexaco corp 
talks between the two companies were continuing late thursday  although specific terms of the stock swap had not been determined  the sources said 
dynegy  s board is waiting for word from the major credit rating agencies to determine whether the acquisition would result in a significant downgrade of enron  s debt  only when dynegy  s board is comfortable with that situation will it negotiate specific terms  the sources said 
enron stock and credit ratings have plunged after off  the  balance sheet deals now under investigation by the u  s  securities and exchange commission for possible conflict of interest were disclosed in mid  october 
the deals contributed to a   billion third  quarter charge and     billion reduction in shareholder equity that earned the ire of wall street  which has been clamoring for an explanation ever since 
enron on thursday restated its financial statements since   which reduced its earnings by   million  or  percent  over the four years ending in   and increased the company  s debt by   million  or  percent

moody  s diaz on enron credit downgrade and outlook  comment
new york  nov    bloomberg    john diaz  a managing
director at moody  s investors service  who covers enron  comments
on the company  s downgrade of enron corp   s long  and short  term
debt ratings and the possibility that dynegy inc  may buy it 
moody  s lowered enron  s short  term credit rating to   not
prime   from   p     its lowest investment grade level  it also
downgraded the no   energy trader  s long  term debt rating one
notch to   baa     the lowest investment  grade rating    from
  baa    
on why short  term ratings are junk  while long  term aren  t 
  the downgrade reflects the weak liquidity position of the
company and that it has no access to the commercial paper
market   
on company outlook and ability to remain investment  grade 
  enron has enough liquidity to last for several months as
long as counter  parties continue to trade with it and the line of
credit it is negotiating with its banks   is closed 
enron now needs to   shore up confidence in the company so
that counter  parties continue to trade with it    he said    if
that goes away  it becomes a precarious situation  which is
something that has been pretty clear to the market for awhile   
on possible dynegy purchase of enron 
enron did provide moody  s with a pro  forma balance sheet
should the company reach an agreement with dynegy  but that had
  no bearing   on the downgrade  because   no deal has been
formally announced  and that would be putting the cart before the
horse   
  if a deal happens with dynegy  there is a real potential of
stabilizing the situation  absent some equity or liquidity
infusion into enron    the company could be downgraded to junk
status 
  enron needs to have liquidity to shore up its operations 
it has liquidity to last for several months  as long as counter 
parties continue to trade with it   and the bank deal is signed 
a deal with dynegy could   end up with a capital structures
that would be improved over time  and we would look at that
liquidity structure   
on dynegy  s credit ratings 
when people talk about dynegy  they should look at the
  baa    rating  which belongs to dynegy holdings  they shouldn  t
look at its parent  dynegy inc  the assets are at the holdings
level    because of the holding company structure  the parent 
dynegy inc  is rated one notch lower   
  bond holders at the dynegy holdings level are ahead of
those at dynegy inc

new york  nov    bloomberg    andre meade  an energy
analyst at commerzbank securities  comments on a possible takeover
of enron corp   the largest energy trader  by smaller rival dynegy
inc  meade doesn  t own shares of dynegy or enron 
  dynegy is essentially betting the company on their ability
to clean up the messes at enron and seamlessly integrate enron  s
people into its own trading business without losing traders 
volumes and the margins that enron makes   
  with the restatement of earnings yesterday it  s clear enron
had a number of things inflating its earnings  such as the off 
balance sheet transactions  i  m not convinced there aren  t further
restatements to come  it calls into question the earnings power of
enron  s business   
  even though enron  s price is low by historical standards 
dynegy is making a big bet and it  s a risky bet  it will be
difficult to make it work   
on the possible effect of an enron bankruptcy on the market 
  since enron is the largest trader of power and gas and most
traders have receivables with enron or owe enron money there would
be a flurry of activity of figuring out who owes what  who will
get paid and when  it would have an impact on the short  term   
  the markets will continue to function but there would be
less churn  that  s transactions between traders  i don  t see a big
problem   
  it is a big unknown and i  m sure most traders would be
happy to see enron continue

the combination would make dynegy the largest energy trader
and owner of the second  biggest u  s  natural  gas pipeline system 
  bondholders needed them to stabilize the situation  and
that  s what this deal does  it  s one of the rare outcomes for a
troubled situation like this  where the bondholders come out in
better shape the equity holders   
through yesterday  enron shares had fallen  percent this
year  enron  s    percent notes due in  rose to around 
cents on the dollar in midmorning trading  up from  cents
earlier 
  there  s not really a quality market out there   for enron  s
bonds  stapley said    we  re flying in the dark as to price  but
the direction in which we  re flying in the dark is toward higher
prices   
  there seems to be flexibility for the inevitable write 
offs  as dynegy begins to delve into enron  s finances  there are
still risks for dynegy  this adds uncertainty to their balance
sheet  can they retain enron  s talent  how deep are their pockets 
it looks like more money will have to go into enron

dynegy bid for enron said to be possible bail  out deal
monica perin houston business journal
dynegy  s bid to acquire struggling energy giant enron corp  may actually be a bail  out deal for dynegy  industry experts say 
dynegy may be  so exposed to enron that if enron goes down  dynegy could go down with them   according to one industry insider 
wall street  may look at the purchase of enron as a self bail  out by dynegy due to its exposure to enron and industry liquidity concerns   analysts mark easterbrook and neal dingmann of rbc dain rauscher securities firm concur in a market report on enron on thursday 
 an outright bid for enron by dynegy would  in our opinion  not be received well by wall street  
the two analysts say an equity infusion of cash from one or many sources rather than an outright sale of enron would be preferable  but  they maintain  the infusion strategy  makes little sense for dynegy  and its part  owner  chevron 
for one thing  dynegy  s balance sheet would not be sufficient to take over enron without the deep pockets of chevron  which is reported to be offering     billion in cash to enron now and another billion if and when the deal closes 
 i believe ken lay  enron chairman and ceo  approached dynegy and chevron because he has already tried everybody else and he is facing the prospect of selling off enron piecemeal   says jean rollins  managing partner for c  three  a market consulting and research firm   enron is being shopped in pieces all over the market   she says 
enron has already talked to royal dutch  shell  general electric  and several big foreign energy companies  apparently without success  rollins notes  however  it is also rumored that enron may be seeking a  white knight  to save it from a takeover by shell  and  in order to secure a deal with dynegy  rollins believes enron may have disclosed to dynegy financial information that had not been made public 
meanwhile  all of enron  s trading partners are nervously reviewing their own exposure and watching developments 
kansas city  based utilicorp announced today it is buying back the  percent of its trading subsidiary  aquila  that it spun off in an initial public offering just last spring 
part of the reason  sources say  is that aquila has been trying to acquire assets from enron in the last couple of weeks but couldn  t get the credit it needed because energy trading and power  producing companies have been shut out of the equity markets since the enron meltdown began 
other energy trading companies have been measuring their exposure to enron but have been vague about disclosing their risk  say easterbrook and dingmann 
some industry watchers say a merger between enron and dynegy would catch intense anti  trust scrutiny from the ftc and the justice department while others disagree 
their physical assets don  t overlap and there would be no market limitations on their trading operations  maintains john sodergreen  editor and publisher of scudder online energy trade publications 
one insider believes lay has no intention of selling enron and that  while he may have his back against a wall  he is still in a position to dictate terms to dynegy because of that company  s exposed position  this source sees enron surviving with chevron holding a big chunk of it as well as a bigger piece of dynegy

moody  s cut its rating because enron  s finances had
deteriorated  said john diaz  a managing director who follows the
company for moody  s    the downgrade reflects the weak liquidity
position of the company and that it has no access to the

that goes away  it becomes a precarious situation  which is

investors said that dynegy will face a challenge in
incorporating enron  s business 
  dynegy has to move fast if it  s going to keep enron  s
traders and enron  s trading customers    said roger hamilton  a
money manager with john hancock advisers inc   which sold its
enron shares in recent weeks 
  this would make them far and a way the biggest energy
trading operation  and a dramatic rescue would help the approval
process  which might have been difficult in other circumstances

chief executive officer hal kvisle comments on the possible sale
of enron corp  to houston rival dynegy inc  and transcanada  s
decision to sell its natural  gas trading business 
calgary  based transcanada  which had been canada  s biggest
gas trader  agreed last month to sell its trading units to bp plc
and mirant corp  enron is canada  s second  biggest gas trader 
on concerns the sale would reduce competition in gas trading 
  in north america  there are six or eight major gas traders
that are all highly competitive  the margins in gas trading have
become very slim  it  s extraordinarily difficult to manage and
administer  monitoring the risks and ensuring that things aren  t
going wrong   
  that is one tough business to stay on top of  we  re frankly
glad to be out of it   
  we don  t think the acquisition of enron by some other
player would bring too much market concentration into one party  s
hands   
  we think there are many other players in the gas marketing
and trading arena that are very capable of growing their
businesses and making sure competition will be there   
on the decision to sell its gas  trading units 
  one of the reasons that we decided to exit the trading
sector was that the barriers to entry were few   
  if you go back  years ago  transcanada had a  percent
share of the gas that was exported from alberta  other than the
volume that went to california  as the market opened  enron was
one of the earliest to enter but certainly many others have
entered over time
