subject  kitchen  nettleton tax and misc issues
david
further to our conversation last week  i have managed to get some information that i hope will be useful for louise  although i am still unclear about the exact circumstances  issues 
  there should not be a problem with louise  s  return in terms of her name  nettleton was listed on the return and kitchen was listed on the estimated payment vouchers  as long as the social security numbers are the same  it is unlikely that there will be any issue with the irs but if they do come back to lousie asking for clarification  pwc will write them a letter explaining the situation and that will be it 
  issues with louise  s  return  if possible  pwc houston suggest that if louise  s social security card says nettleton  still not sure about this as pwc do not ask for copies of the ss cards   then any information that the company sends to the irs must also list her name as nettleton  louise  s us payroll has the name kitchen and thus w  will have the name kitchen  if she would like to change her name and the company documents  she can do this via a form on the web http    isc  enron  com  dynamic  hrforms  hr   form  personal   data   change  doc 
  in order for louise to change her name to nettleton in the uk  according to julie this is what needs to happen   we only require a certified copy of the marriage certificate  and then both london hr service and enron london payroll should be notified  the service centre should change her name  payroll will advise the providers  such as shareplan  and benefits   pwc london have confirmed that if louise wishes to change her name to nettleton with the uk tax office  they will be happy to write a letter on her behalf advising them as such  they will await her confirmation before doing so  though 
chuck  if any of the above is incorrect of if you wish to add anything  please do so asap so that david can get back with louise 
regards
