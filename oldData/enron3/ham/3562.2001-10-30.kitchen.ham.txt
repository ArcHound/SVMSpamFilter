  enron is atrocious today    he said 
undisclosed
the largest energy trader  s troubles began two weeks ago when
it reported     billion in losses  including more than  
million written off on a competitive energy supplier business and
a bandwidth trading business  enron formed at least  affiliated
companies to buy and sell company assets  according to records
from the texas secretary of state  some of those affiliates
profited from buying or selling assets to enron 
the houston  based company losses included   million from
partnerships set up by chief financial officer andrew fastow 
fastow was later fired and the u  s  securities and exchange
commission has asked for information about the transactions 
the disclosure has set off concern among investors about how
little is known about enron  s balance sheet and caused ratings
companies to examine the company 
  investors are nervous about this name    said freda lam  a
credit strategist at j  p  morgan chase  co  in new york 
investor relations
enron  s long  term debt rating was cut yesterday to   baa    
two levels above junk  from   baal    moody  s also placed the
houston  based company  s   p     rating for commercial paper  
borrowing for nine  months or less   on review for downgrade 
enron has been shut off from the commercial paper market since the
ratings agencies began the review 
the lack of access to money markets makes it more difficult
for enron to borrow the short  term cash needed to run its trading
businesses  ahead of a potential cut  enron took out bank lines to
repay   billion in commercial paper last week 
still  most of wall street expects enron  s bonds to be paid
and its stock price to bounce back 
  we suspect that enron  s share price will not likely recover
in the near term    lam said    we ultimately expect this company
to be successful  but it needs to improve its investor relations
and its disclosure

new york  afx   shares of enron corp were sharply lower in afternoon trade  losing over  pct  on concern over the company  s credit worthiness  a day after it said it is negotiating with banks for a new credit line and moody  s investor service cut the company  s senior unsecured long  term debt ratings  dealers said 
at    pm  shares of enron were trading    usd lower  or    pct  at

on monday  moody  s said it has lowered the senior unsecured long  term debt ratings of enron corp to baa  from baal following a deterioration in the company  s financial flexibility since it announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments 
the long  term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade  moody  s said 
in its third  quarter results two weeks ago  enron announced a charge of    bln usd  or    usd per share  and an incremental    bln usd reduction stockholders  equity  related to the unwinding of investments with the ljm partnerships 
the securities and exchange commission requested the company to provide information on these related  party transactions days later  many analysts responded by cutting the shares ratings on concerns that dealings with the related ljm partnership  connected to its then chief financial officer  andrew fastow  may affect future earnings 
fastow was dismissed by enron  s board last thursday for his involvement in running the ljm partnerships  in which enron had invested 
enron  s heavy investments in water  broadband and international energy have come under significant pressure in the wake of the current economic deterioration 
following the company  s third  quarter results  investors have been abandoning the stock in droves  worried that the valuation and credibility of enron  s core business  merchant energy  is at risk   the big bets that enron took on water and broadband were designed to overcome future limits to growth in its very successful energy merchant business and propel enron into a new league of company 
 the bets turned out to be too big  and regrouping after they failed is the root of the current confusion over enron  s forward prospects   said duane grubert  an analyst at bernstein 
while enron can survive on its own  its reputation and branding has been damaged  said grubert  noting that a partnership might be the best long term solution for the energy trader 
the major issue for the company is maintaining its credit worthiness on long  term investment grade rating of its debt 
 if that rating is lost  the merchant business will not be able to transact with its normal addressable market  and income is likely to shrink quickly

the report  which was much worse than wall street expectations for a fall to     said a rebound in confidence was not likely any time soon  fading consumer confidence could undermine consumer spending  which drives two  thirds of activity in an economy most believe is already in recession 
the third  quarter earnings reporting season is winding down  but wall street is girding for this week  s heavy load of economic data  the data will include reports on jobs  manufacturing and third  quarter growth  which could point to a recession

david haffenreffer  cnnfn anchor  before hours  welcome back  investors are watching for the next move from the nation  s largest natural gas and power marketing company  enron  url  http     www  enron  com    the battered energy trader attempting to establish credit lines  and moody  s downgraded the company  s credit rating to just a couple of notches above junk status  enron  s stock  take a look at this  plunged more than  percent  that was just yesterday  it has lost about  percent over the past two weeks 
how are enron  s woes affecting the natural gas market  joining us now is robert collins  the president of the new york mercantile exchange  and welcome back to the program 
j  robert collins  president  nymex  thank you 
haffenreffer  certainly enron is very much involved in the trading of natural gas  and this has got to where which trades on the nymex  how have the levels  the of high levels  of certainty surrounding this companies current problems affected that 
collins  well  any time that a company goes through a short term period of troubles  the industry surrounding that  that has an intricate layer of credit relationships  is concerned about their ability to be paid 
haffenreffer  but for people who don  t know what enron does  what role do they play in the trading of natural gas futures 
collins  well  they are a major counter  party in the natural gas industry in trading  selling and distributing natural gas  and so  they have an extensive network of credit relationship with virtually every natural gas company in the north american industry 
haffenreffer  are they involved  in some way  with almost every trade having to do with natural gas  are they that big 
collins  no  i wouldn  t say that they  re involved with every trade  they  re involved in a substantial amount of trading through their electronic market making system  but  no  they  re only a component of the market  and only do  perhaps  a percentage of what trades on the nymex 
haffenreffer  so when trading takes place  and it  s very fast  there  s a lot of money changing hands all the time  there  s a lot of credit given to people trading and when a company like enron has got some liquidity problems  or just even fears of liquidity problems  that can affect people who do trades with them 
collins  yes  absolutely  it can cause people to retract from trading  it can cause disruptions in the natural flow of trading  it  s not unlike the financial markets at all  when you have a serious credit concern 
haffenreffer  as result  the nymex is working at a faster clip to get a clearing service set up  is that right  and explain what role will that have in easing people  s fears 
collins  well  last night  the board approved offering a new service called over  the  counter clearing  we  re extending it initially on our primary natural gas contract  the henry hub natural gas futures  what that does is allow counter  parties that perhaps may question each other  s credit worthiness to place the trade on the exchange clearing mechanism  that  s a network of  financial institutions and has aa credit standard 
haffenreffer  real quick  it  s been about a month and a half since september  th 
collins  yes 
haffenreffer  are things back to normal 
collins  i wouldn  t say that they  re back to normal  although every day gets a little better 
haffenreffer  all right  good to see you 
collins  thank you

you want to know when you can buy enron  ene  nyse  news  commentary   it will have nothing to do with the fundamentals  i  m pretty sure that the investment banks will do whatever is necessary to keep this oil and gas version of long term capital management  the hedge fund that blew up  in business  if only because it was everybody  s best client 
these days  though  when concentration of holdings among mutual funds is still the rage  as idiotic as it is  all you need to know about enron  s bottoming is when janus is done selling it  janus  aggressive buying   the fund owned  million shares of this thing not long ago  which is a staggering concentration   moved the stock up to begin with 
my sources indicate that janus has been dumping the stock  i don  t think you can possibly make a decision whether to buy it without knowing when janus is done  that  s the key material fact  not whether enron gets the credit line 
the game wasn  t always like this  other than ken heebner in the   s  most mutual fund managers didn  t try to be bigger than the market  they didn  t try to move up stocks by buying  and they certainly didn  t wreck stocks on the go out 
ah  but the years  and  have brought about a different paradigm  when these mutual funds dump  they dump terribly and really damage the stock  which then damages the company  which then damages the company  s credit  which then further damages the stock again  it is a really vicious circle that starts with the selling by the funds that created the darling 
i wouldn  t touch this stock unless i knew that janus was done selling  of course  that will be a big secret  because janus sure isn  t going to tell you  and the broker isn  t going to tell you  i have had brokers on the sly tell me when these folks have finished  but i fear that janus will finish with one broker then just go to another  as that is also their  style  of trading  i put quote marks on style because the reality is that a  style  would mean they know how to trade out of a big position  and these folks really don  t 
of course  what they should have done is gotten a bid for  million shares down two or three points rather than play this drib and drab game  but they never did learn to sell at that shop  which is another reason why you can  t do business with them now that the market is no longer straight  up 
so there really will be no way of knowing until you see the volume of this stock rise and the stock itself start going up  for those of you who believe enron will make it  it  s best to miss the first two points just to be sure janus is done  i will keep my eyes out for you  too 
we  ll spot the bottom  if there is one  together 
random musings  think you are a good trader  think you can trade with the big boys  think you want to be able to catch on with a hedge fund  want to pick up five g  s in the interim  ok  then  enter our trading contest  that  s right  we have a contest where there  s real money on the line once you have entered it  real prize money  this could be the test  the verified test  you need to show guys like berko  my old partner  that you know how to trade to make money  i can  t tell you how valuable that validation can be for your career

germany  german watchdog may sue firms over power charges 
by claire  louise isted
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
frankfurt  oct   reuters   germany  s cartel office said on tuesday it would take legal action against four utilities if they did not change the way they charge competitors for power used to keep the grid in balance 
 we have to wait for the reaction of the four companies to see if they will change their accounting system so that they do not hinder other competitiors   cartel office spokesman stefan siebert told reuters 
 if they don  t do that  then ultimately we could issue an injunction to force them to do so  
the competition authority said earlier in a statement it had received complaints that grid operators bewag  bklg  de  enbw  hew and veag that the four firms  charge their competitors unreasonable and partly fictitious costs  for balancing energy 
german grid operators have sole control over the purchase and sale of such power in their grid areas  which they control by temporarily switching on and off their power plants  this poses a potential threat to other power suppliers 
 new entrants to the german market  such as london  s enron capital  resources and hamburg  s lichtblick  because of their small customer portfolios  cannot balance unplanned amounts of power withdrawn as well as the big utilitiy groups can   the statement said 
 consequently they have a greater need for balancing energy  and  are threatened with the considerable burden of unreasonable prices for it  
the four utilities have argued that the accounting system they use for balancing energy corresponds to guidelines in the country  s association agreement  vv    which is due to be modified by next year 
 illegal cartel conduct cannot be justified through the association agreement   said cartel office president ulf boege in the statement 
 references to the agreement show rather that there is an urgent need for action in vv   which is currently being modified  to develop regulations on the accounting of balancing energy that conform with cartel law   he added 
utilities rwe and e  on have introduced an auction system for their balancing energy needs to provide a market to other potential generators  as a condition of their respective mergers last year 
rwe net  s regulating power manager klaus albers said last week that the system it introduced in april  which is based on a cartel office model  had not so far produced the lower prices it was designed to 
he said he expected all grid operators to introduce a market for their balancing energy needs within two years
