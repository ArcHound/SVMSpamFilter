Subject hpl close
great job to all   we made it from contract execution to financial close in  months  this success is a testament to the effort put forth by all of you and your colleagues in finalizing the transaction  including 
  setting an industry record for responding to a  nd request from the dept  of justice and securing their approval 
  expediting the analysis and repair of a  mile segment of the a  s pipeline 
  transitioning hpl  s hardware and software infrastructure from enron to aep
  unwinding four complex monetizations related to the assets with a value of over   mm
  separating hpl  s business process  work flow  from enron  after  years of integrated operation 
  segregating property between leased and purchased facilities
  collecting and sorting over    boxes of books and records
  moving over  people from  different enron entities into a new location while keeping the pipeline operating 
  accounting for the transfer of prm assets  cwip  leased assets  purchased assets  imbalances  payables and receivables 
the transaction freed up approximately   mm of capital that enron can put to work earning higher rates of return in its newer businesses  but the work on hpl is not over yet  there are a number of follow up activities that we need to complete in order to maximize the value of the hpl transaction  jim coffey will be managing these activities on an ongoing basis  including 
  collecting outstanding accounts receivable and working with aep to resolve imbalances 
  closing out accounting entries for property  work orders  external accounts payable  and internal charges 
  eliminating and mitigating any impact from retained assets and liabilities 
  fully transitioning hpl systems  facilities  and books  records to aep 
again  thank you for your effort  and if i have inadvertently missed anyone please pass along my appreciation to them as well  we will be hosting a lunch for the enron  hpl employees who worked on the transaction on the  th of june at    in the imperial ballroom at the hyatt regency hotel  please attend if your schedule permits 
regards
