Subject vitro project  sale of equity
louise 
i believe the following will clarify the question from our meeting yesterday 
the   mm figure that i was showing to you represents the npv  discounted       of the future cashflows of the project for   ownership from june   through dec    this number does not include the moneys than enron will have put into the project by that time  the amount put by enron by that time will be   mm  for   
if we do de transaction  we will get the following cashflows 
the premium     mm
reimbursement of   of the   mm already put by enron     mm
keep   of future npvs     mm
the potential investor will contribute in the future the equity contributions for   of the ownership
the potential investor will give us in june   the amount of future equity contributions for the   of the ownership
the above shows the cashflows that we will be received under the  alternatives but this does not reflect the transaction from an earnings perspective 
from the earnings perspective  the following is a simplified estimation of earnings for the next  years under the two situations 
please  let me know if you need further clarification
thanks  mar  a elena
