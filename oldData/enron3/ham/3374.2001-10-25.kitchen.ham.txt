enron corp  replaced its embattled chief financial officer  andrew s  fastow  capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major energy  trading companies 
investors appeared worried that enron  s recent woes could have a destabilizing effect on the energy  trading market  the houston energy powerhouse  with annualized revenue topping   billion and assets of more than   billion  handles transactions representing roughly one  quarter of the nation  s traded  electricity and natural  gas volumes  in less than two years of operation  its enrononline trading platform has become a central marketplace for the energy business and already has handled more than   billion in transactions 
 enron makes the market  make no mistake about that   said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey   there  s not a trader out there that doesn  t use enrononline   as such  enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company  s credit  worthiness is critical  enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday  the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid 
enron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon  the   year  old head of the company  s industrial  markets division  his selection may be intended  in part  to raise the company  s credibility  people familiar with the matter say mr  mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr  fastow  s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron  internal partnership documents indicate mr  fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships  mr  fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict  of  interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors  on monday  enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow  related transactions 
while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr  fastow  as well as the company  s dealings with the partnerships  controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive  s departure   in my continued discussions with the financial community  it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo   said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement 
enron said mr  fastow  will be on a leave of absence from the company   he couldn  t be reached for comment 
it remains to be seen how much mr  fastow  s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community  the action came after the  p  m  market close and followed a day in which enron  s stock once again plunged  as of  p  m  in new york stock exchange composite trading  enron shares were at      down      or    it topped the big board  s most active list at nearly  million shares  more than twice the volume of the second  most  active stock  several trades yesterday involved blocks of    shares or more  possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock 
enron  s shares are down about   from the beginning of last week  earlier this year  the stock was above   a share 
in an apparent ripple effect  the stocks of other energy  trading companies  which do business with enron  also fell sharply yesterday  for instance  dynegy inc  shares on the big board were off      or    at      a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron  s  which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles 
prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr  fastow  s departure could be seen as evidence that  management does care  about investor concerns  however  she adds  the move also could be viewed by some investors  coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry  as  an admission of guilt   ms  coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company  s extremely complex financial structure 
enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow  related dealings 
worries and rumors about enron  s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday  goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible  death spiral  in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company  which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions  mr  fleischer  a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company  said he hasn  t yet seen any evidence of such a problem 
however  mr  fleischer said  enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities  enron is facing a problem with  trust and credibility  it  s not easy to regain something as basic as trust   he said

enron ousts finance chief as s  e  c  looks at dealings

the enron corporation  its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence  yesterday ousted its chief financial officer  andrew s  fastow  whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission 
  in my continued discussions with the financial community  it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c  f  o     kenneth l  lay  enron  s chairman and chief executive  said in a statement announcing the change  only one day before  mr  lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board   continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy   
the company said that mr  fastow had taken a leave of absence  but it also named his successor  jeffrey mcmahon  the head of enron  s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer 
enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night 
the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange  where enron  s shares fell      to      the price has been cut in half since oct    when enron reported its third  quarter earnings  a     billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr  fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release  mr  lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed  but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate   billion write  off that was disclosed in the earnings document  and were angered when they later learned about it 
on tuesday  when both mr  fastow and mr  lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call  neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr  fastow  mr  lay cited the s  e  c  inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions 
the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year  but enron  s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand 
by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock  it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses  but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement  that is one of the issues the s  e  c   whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company  is expected to address 
concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying   either in cash or with stock   if things went wrong  on tuesday  mr  fastow assured investors that the company   expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations    and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate 
mr  fastow was viewed as one of the architects  with jeffrey k  skilling  the former enron chief executive who resigned in august  of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas  pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following  its stock price peaked in the summer of  at     
according to a person close to the company  while mr  mcmahon  mr  fastow  s successor  was enron  s treasurer  he told mr  skilling  who at the time was the chief operating officer  that he thought the partnerships involving mr  fastow presented a conflict of interest  after that discussion  mr  mcmahon moved to a different job at the company  this person said 
shares of enron traded as low as     yesterday afternoon  the lowest price for the stock since early   before recovering  in after  hours trading  they fell to     
one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m  carol coale  an analyst at prudential securities  to drop her rating to   sell   from   hold    she had lowered the rating to   hold   from   buy   on monday 
  after the s  e  c  inquiry was announced    she said in an interview yesterday evening    enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat  as a gesture to the street  now they are replacing him today  the timing is a little late  but i think it will be received positively by the street   
but she said that investor sentiment might work the other way    people could fear that if you remove fastow from the management team  you  ll never get any answers

enron replaces cfo to reassure investors
by laura goldberg
copyright  houston chronicle
in a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on wall street  houston  based enron corp  removed its chief financial officer wednesday  as federal securities regulators review business dealings between enron and two investment partnerships that he ran 
enron  the world  s largest energy trader  said chief financial officer andrew fastow had been put on a  leave of absence  for an undetermined period and named another enron executive  jeff mcmahon  as his replacement  the company said the move was not a reflection on fastow or a belief that he had done anything improper 
 in my continued discussions with the financial community  it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo   enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares 
enron  which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons  found itself high on wall street  s hit list after it released third  quarter earnings on oct  
the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at  fastow  with the approval of enron  s board  had formed and run two investment partnerships   ljm cayman and ljm  co  investment 
the partnerships  which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron  served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments 
but wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron  s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time 
so fastow  in june  resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities  during the third  quarter  enron took a   million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a     billion reduction in shareholder equity 
tuesday  lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the ljm partnerships  he said a  chinese wall  existed between enron and ljm 
fastow  s replacement  mcmahon  previously served as enron  s treasurer before moving last year to another job with enron  most recently  he headed up the company  s industrial markets group  a source close to enron said mcmahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer  s job because he was uncomfortable with the fastow  ljm setup 
enron spokesman mark palmer said neither fastow nor mcmahon was available for comment wednesday  he also didn  t know whether fastow is still receiving a salary 
enron disclosed on monday that federal securities regulators had begun an  informal inquiry  into the ljm dealings 
the news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications  water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of ceo jeff skilling in august for personal reasons 
a continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron followed the earnings report and the news of the sec inquiry 
wall street has stepped up its chronic complaints that enron  s various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations 
beyond the ljm partnerships  investors are concerned about two other partnerships enron set up  among the worries is that enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities 
investors wouldn  t like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares  they are also afraid that enron  s debt credit rating may be downgraded  which could have negative impacts on its overall business 
in the last six days  enron  s shares have closed lower and lower  on oct    the stock closed at      on wednesday it closed at      down     
wednesday  the hubbub surrounding enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading  including houston  based dynegy  which closed down     at      there is concern enron  s woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets 
a conference call lay and senior executives  including fastow  held with analysts tuesday to help clear up questions didn  t go as enron hoped 
on wednesday  carol coale  an analyst with prudential securities in houston  moved from a  hold  to a  sell  rating

front page  first section  enron replaces finance chief  energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price 
enron  the us energy group  yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer  andrew fastow  to try to halt a slide in its share price  which has lost about  per cent of its value this week 
kenneth lay  enron  s chief executive officer  said after the market closed that mr fastow was taking a leave of absence  the move came a day after mr lay defended mr fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced enron to take a     bn write  off 
that loss  revealed last week  sparked the share sell  off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come  enron disclosed the loss during an october  conference call with analysts on its third  quarter results  saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that enron had set up in the partnerships established with mr fastow 
analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained  leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission 
 in my continued discussions with the financial community  it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo   mr lay said  he said jeff mcmahon  chairman and chief executive of enron  s industrial markets group  would replace mr fastow  mr mcmahon earlier served as enron  s treasurer 
analysts said it was unclear whether mr fastow  s departure would be enough  carol coale  of prudential securities  said the move was positive in demonstrating that enron was being sensitive to wall street  which had called for mr fastow to be replaced  yet  she added  it came three days after those calls 
ms coale issued a  sell  recommendation on enron earlier yesterday  leading to a drop of almost  per cent in its share price   we are concerned about what we don  t know   ms coale said  she was concerned that enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating  or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet  enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure 
enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the sec inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong  lex  page

shares in enron  the us energy group  fell again yesterday after prudential securities issued a  sell  note on concerns that the     bn loss taken by the company last week might not be the end of its bad news 
in the first hour of new york stock exchange trading  enron  s stock was the biggest percentage loser  dropping    per cent to      its lowest level since august   
 we are concerned about what we don  t know   said carol coale  the prudential analyst who covers enron 
she was disappointed that enron had not been more forthcoming in the conference call it held on tuesday in response to charges it was not being transparent 
investors have been abandoning the stock since october   when enron told analysts it was taking a     bn loss in shutting down funding mechanisms it had set up in controversial partnerships established with andrew fastow  the chief financial officer 
this charge has not been thoroughly explained  leading to confusion among analysts and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission 
ms coale said she was concerned enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating  or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet  she said enron might lose customers to competitors that are not under such pressure

enron
to lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune  to lose the chief financial officer as well looks like carelessness 
enron  s effort to increase transparency  revealing more operating data in its third quarter release  was undermined by its decision to gloss over a     bn equity charge related to the closing of  related party transactions  with two off  balance sheet financing vehicles  and it neglected to mention that the vehicles were run by andrew fastow  its cfo  conflict of interest anyone 
the securities and exchange commission is conducting an informal inquiry  investors  angry after the initial revelation  had reason to feel more so after its conference call  which was supposed to clear up confusion over the financing vehicles and related party transactions  the call had the opposite effect 
the charge to shareholders  equity  and the related reduction in notes receivable  was the result of closing one of the vehicles  and the termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver enron shares  the uncertainty is whether enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles  credit concerns and lack of disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices  enron is unlikely to lose its investment grade status  but dilution is a real risk for shareholders  mr fastow has gone  following jeffrey skilling  former chief executive  who quit after only six months as ceo   but the credibility problem goes beyond one individual

baring asset management  s mcclen on enron  investor comments
         new york 
london  oct    bloomberg    the following are comments by
catherine mcclen  who helps manage about   billion of bonds for
baring asset management  about enron corp 
yesterday  enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow
amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
  million  mcclen said baring bought credit  linked notes issued
by houston  based enron during the summer 
  given what has happened  with them basically firing andy
fastow  the cfo  they  ve finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management  credibility issue    on a recent
conference call   no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors  concerns   
  they were slightly hiding behind the fact that the sec has
got this inquiry going  the fact that two days later andy is gone 
and he was in the center  is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are   
  there  s always that worry once the sec gets involved that
it could extend  you never know what could come of that   
  there is a bit of fear of the unknown about enron now  with
the sec inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write  downs   
  another thing they  re criticized for is their lack of
disclosure  we still haven  t seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter   
  people are saying  why don  t you include a balance sheet
with your results  they promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter   
  you  d like to see just more information on asset write 
downs and a discussion of their off  balance  sheet financing   all
these vehicles they have like marlin and osprey   
  we  d like to see some clarity  answering those sort of
questions   
  it seems as though enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they  re going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they  ve started to replace management   
  investors have already had enough issues   in corporate
bonds recently and   sometimes investors just think   not another
nasty in my portfolio   and i  d rather exit   
  for certain investors maybe they just get scared  i wanted
to know more about it  people had speculated if it could go to
junk  i don  t think they could because i don  t think enron could
exist as a junk company   
  there  s a certain reluctance   to sell the bonds    you
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals   
  when the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it  s a buying opportunity

enron ousts cfo amid partnership questions

copyright   the associated press  all rights reserved 
houston  ap   enron corp  may have added another question to the list investors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the company stressed its confidence in andrew fastow amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry 
 it could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if enron removed the cfo at the request of the sec   prudential securities inc  analyst carol coale said wednesday   who knows  
enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant  s stocks have declined in value each day since monday  s announcement that the sec had inquired about partnerships that did business with enron while they were managed by fastow 
 in my continued discussions with the financial community  it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo   enron chief executive officer kenneth lay said after markets closed wednesday 
fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while jeff mcmahon  who has served as chairman and chief executive of enron  s industrial markets group  takes over his role 
 i think change is good at this particular point in time   said fac equities analyst robert christensen said   i think andy was somewhat beleaguered  
a  g  edwards  sons analyst mike heim  however  said it will take more than replacing fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about enron and its partnerships 
 i think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements   heim said 
replacing fastow alone won  t clarify those arrangements  he added 
 there is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community   heim said   instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever  
enron  s stock continued to plummet wednesday  closing down     to     per share  a  percent decline 
since the wall street journal first reported on the partnerships last week  enron  s stock price has slid nearly  percent 
 the market was asking for that to happen   j  p  morgan analyst anatol feygin said of fastow  s departure   this is really the first time enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis  
previously  enron  s managers have been  cautious and defensive in their approach   he said 
during a conference call tuesday to address investor concern  lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as fastow carried out the dual roles  the partnerships have since been dissolved 
the call didn  t work for many  including feygin and heim 
 i didn  t hear things like we  ve unrolled all these partnership dealings or here  s all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don  t ever expect to take any more charges   heim said   what i heard is we don  t have to disclose that information until the   q is filed  
the turbulent past few months which have included the sec inquiry  third quarter losses and the august resignation of the company  s chief executive officer  jeff skilling  have left many analysts questioning the company  s future  heim said 
 it  s really a speculative bet right now  but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now  two years from now   he said 
but much is going to depend on how much enron discloses to its investors  feygin said 
feygin said mcmahon worked as enron  s treasurer for two years under fastow before a disagreement over fastow  s involvement in the partnerships caused mcmahon to leave his job as treasurer 
 internally  jeff was always a proponent of andy not being involved in  the partnerships    feygin said   three days ago i would have said there is no need for a change at the cfo level  today  it was pretty obvious it was something enron needed to do

facing a crisis of confidence in the market  enron corp  replaced its chief financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble 
after failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage  control conference call tuesday  the houston  based energy trader dropped chief financial officer andrew fastow  who has been linked to transactions being looked at by the securities and exchange commission  he was replaced by former treasurer jeff mcmahon 
the move came after enron shares  ene  nyse  dropped us     to us      the stock has dropped   in the past two weeks   wiping out us    billion of shareholder wealth 
 in my continued discussions with the financial community  it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo   enron chief executive kenneth lay said 
early last week  enron reported a us    million third  quarter loss  resulting from us      billion in write  offs 
the company also disclosed a us      billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by mr  fastow 
in july  mr  fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors  the sec is currently looking into the partnership arrangement 
the turmoil of the past several days prompted enron to schedule a conference call tuesday morning with wall street analysts to reassure investors 
during the call  enron officials declined to specify mr  fastow  s role in the partnership  citing the ongoing sec investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing mr  fastow to create and run the partnerships 
the stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst carol coale of prudential financial downgraded the stock for the second time this week  to  sell  from  hold   ms  coale said the rating change is  not because of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don  t know about the company  
volume was very heavy  with    million shares changing hands  average daily volume is    million shares 
j  p  morgan analyst anatol feygin was also less than impressed with enron  s line during the conference call 
the company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of us      billion in shareholder equity  but mr  feygin said management was  defensive  when pressed for details 
ms  coale reduced her price target down us   from us    assuming more bad news was to come 
while the allegations of impropriety cloud enron  mr  feygin said the company  s credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short  term fortunes 
last week  moody  s investors service placed all us    billion of the company  s long  term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade  if moody  s lowered its rating  enron  s short  term debt costs would rise

enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two ljm partnerships run by fastow  which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company

enron corp  ousted andrew fastow as its chief financial officer wednesday  a day after chief executive kenneth lay stressed the company  s confidence in him despite growing controversy over fastow  s role overseeing partnerships that did business with the energy  trading giant 
 in my continued discussions with the financial community  it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo   lay said in a statement  
the company said fastow had taken a leave of absence  but it also named his successor  jeff mcmahon  the head of enron  s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer 
the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange  where enron  s shares fell      to      the price has been cut in half since oct    after enron  s third  quarter earnings release failed to disclose the partnerships

houston   enron corp  ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader   million 
enron named jeff mcmahon  head of its industrial markets group  as cfo because  it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy   chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said 
fastow will take a leave of absence 
shares of enron  based in houston  have plunged   this year  third  quarter charges of     billion from failed investments outside the main commodities trading business wiped out   of the profit earned in the last four quarters 
 investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to andy   said j  p  morgan analyst anatol feygin  who downgraded enron to  long  term buy  and owns no shares 
fastow    ran ljm cayman and ljm  co  investment  two partnerships created by enron to buy company assets  enron  s involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company   million in third  quarter losses 
enron also bought back  million shares from ljm  at a cost of     billion to unwind its investment 
during a conference call tuesday  lay said   i and enron  s board of directors continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy and think he  s doing an outstanding job as cfo  
enron announced that fastow would leave after its stock closed down      or    to     in trading wednesday on the new york stock exchange  setting a new   week low 
the sec began an inquiry into enron  s partnerships monday  spokeswoman karen denne said it is an informal inquiry that enron is cooperating with  and that no subpoenas have been received 
the company has formed at least  affiliated partnerships and corporations  some of which buy and sell enron assets such as power plants  records at the texas secretary of state  s office indicate 
copyright   dow jones a press release says fastow is taking a leave of absence  he  s been replaced by jeffrey mcmahon  formerly ceo of enron  s industrial markets group 
how might the enron bulls spin this  likely  they will point to mcmahon  s alleged opposition to fastow  s role in the big hedging deal  called ljm   to show that the  fastow era  is over  the wall street journal  citing anonymous sources  reported tuesday that as treasurer at enron mcmahon complained about fastow  s possible conflict of interest  probably  the fear was that fastow couldn  t serve enron and ljm  equally  especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from ljm  
clearly  if mcmahon turns out to be a new broom  that  s a positive for enron  an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the journal  s account of mcmahon  s stance on ljm  was correct 
not much else is encouraging  however  fastow  s departure shows that it took massive drops in enron stock to force senior management into action  on a difficult conference call tuesday  ceo ken lay gave fastow resounding backing  it took wednesday  s plunge to get lay to sign off on a new cfo  in other words  lay listens only when the market screams and hollers  how much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much  needed reforms at the company 
the spokeswoman responds that lay had discussions with analysts tuesday and wednesday that led him to the conclusion that fastow  s replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence 
enron culture is thick with financial sorcery  people got upset by one shadowy deal  but no one knows exactly how the company  s core energy trading business makes money  it  s hard to believe the ljm  deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board 
in fact  the chatter is that fastow and former ceo jeff skilling proposed the ljm  transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business  the board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband  so fastow allegedly proposed ljm  as a way to hedge that volatility away  this meant ljm  entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected enron from the downside  should the whole board be on the hook  too  the spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the ljm  transaction if it had not thought it would benefit enron and its shareholders 
lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market  s views  arguably  that  s downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short  term financing  letting things get this bad has risked good faith among enron counterparties and bankers  it shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they  re unavoidable  the spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency 
any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated  but is it any wonder people compare this lot to long term capital management

did enron  ene  nyse  news  commentary  cause the energy crisis  did it create a short squeeze in energy by buying up all available power and hoarding it  perhaps in a series of partnerships that it controlled  did we wipe out billions in equity of utilities in some sort of bizarre zero  sum game in which enron won it all and shareholders from california utilities lost 
and was enron at the hub of a vast power conspiracy to screw the u  s  consumer 
somehow  i believe that if it weren  t for the events of sept   and its aftermath  these questions would be asked right now by a justice department antitrust division or a congressional investigation  to me  this one smells worse than anything that microsoft might have done at one time 
and we need to give some of these departed enron execs immunity to get to the bottom of what may have been the greatest antitrust act in history 
we ought to do it fast  too  while there is some enron left to pay the treble damages that violators owe 
what surprises me is that some enterprising young prosecutor doesn  t want to make his name blowing this one wide open 
this nation must stop at nothing to get the terrorists  but it can  t abandon the white  collar folks  either 
there was just too much money lost too fast for what  in an era where energy seems pretty plentiful  couldn  t possibly  in retrospect  be considered a real shortage

effective board membership is more than a theoretical question  it should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company    this isn  t just a corporate governance
