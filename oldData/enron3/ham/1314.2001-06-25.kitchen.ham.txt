Subject west power orig update
sorry for the delay   
las vegas 
signed up  only condition is hsr  the team is putting together a transition plan to deal with communications  ongoing development  bank interfaces and closing schedules 
saguaro 
submitted non  binding low bid last week to acquire mission  s   interest  waiting for jeff donahue to work out the engagement letter with csfb for the more likely scenario  selling our   interest   i spoke with him friday and he was going to deal with it today   this episode was pretty silly  after andy requested his group  s involvement i sent andy a draft  then sent drafts to donohue  metts  glisan  then called donahue  metts  miller  etc  
longview 
finalized info memorandum  will send out to market later this week  mccook still interested but slow  development is going well but slower than expected  viable epc contractor is modern continental  karen barbour from rac and jake thomas visited them in boston and gained some new respect for their people  experience  approach  credit  etc  we will likely need a dash for late july to put deposits down on additional equipment  i still see this as a q    mm deal without taking any construction risk 
munis 
mcdonald did a small term deal in npl   interestingly it was an index deal through the muni  shasta  to an industrial  kanauf  with whom we executed a financial swap  orig approx   m 
renewables 
air force deal was booked to foster because a mid  marketer worked with elliot to close the deal and also some of the credits we sold had been banked by foster from last year  this is ok with me as long as all of the other wind stuff gets properly credited to orig  anything with ene wind  cinergy  enxco  pacificorp  montana  putting a site to munis  etc    no need to referee 
amps  we pulled the plug on the oregon site  we are about to do the same with the utah site  will continue to support brett if he needs it 
montana  another meeting went well  we are hiring bond and tax counsel to work on the structure  still looks like a   mm prepay tied to a portfolio of assets and contracts  their bid is   escalated at cpi for  mw  x  for  years starting       montana should trade at a discount to mid  c so this is transactable if we can make the stars line up  at their request  we are responding to a montana power rfp for renewables  enron wind has two sites and we are partnering with them in a rfp response
