subject  enron position 
importance  high
it has been our understanding  credit area  both companies  that enron must
prepay for all its purchases including all forward positions ever since
enron was downgraded to bbb minus  unfortunately for enron canada corp   i
cannot convince my board nor my bank to do otherwise 
enron will still get interest from pre  payments that have not been used to
pay for gas that has already been delivered and invoiced 
with the above in mind  here is the current status 
cad 
 carried forward from yesterday     
today  s purchases        large part of which is dec gas
today  s wire      which incidentally has not arrived as yet
balance  short        
jason  kindly
 please followup with your treasury area to see where cad   mm is 
 please  for today  s value date  arrange to send another cad     mm plus
whatever   your traders need for tomorrow 
 your calgary traders have another  tjs of room for day gas at time of
writing this email  purchases so far today    tjs   once the  tjs is
filled  you will be halted 
we thank you for your co  operation
