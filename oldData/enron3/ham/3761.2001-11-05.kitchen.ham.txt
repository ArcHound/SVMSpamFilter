new york  nov   reuters   fitch on monday cut its ratings on the debt of embattled energy trader enron corp  and warned that it may cut the ratings again if the company does not reduce its debts  if its trading business deteriorates or if charges exceed present estimates 
 today  s rating action reflects the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence   fitch said 
fitch cut houston  based enron  s senior unsecured debt to  bbb  minus   one notch above junk  from  bbb  plus   its subordinated debt to  bb  from  bbb   and its commercial paper to  f   from  f    the rating agency also downgraded enron  s preferred stock to  b  plus  from  bbb  minus  
fitch said reducing debt and exiting problem businesses are a management priority  and if enron is successful  the company  s credit profile will improve   however  the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk  particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging  market countries   fitch said 
fitch  s cut follows downgrades last week by moody  s investors service and standard  poor  s  enron  s shares have lost more than  percent in less than a month amid concerns about financial practices that triggered an investigation by the u  s  securities and exchange commission 
s  p last thursday cut enron  s corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to  bbb   two notches above junk status  from  bbb  plus   moody  s investors service last monday cut enron  s senior unsecured debt to  baa    two notches above junk  from  baal  
downgrades could make it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day  to  day business if fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral 
enron lined up   billion of new credit last week but may still have to sell assets to head off a credit squeeze and restore investor confidence  according to investment bankers 
in its third  quarter results report last month  enron said it expected over a billion dollars of write  offs related to soured investments  it also announced an extra     billion write  down of shareholder equity related to investments that were not recorded on its balance sheet 
enron  s    percent notes due in   bid at about  cents on the dollar a week ago  were bid at  cents on the dollar on monday  a strategist said 
enron shares were up  cents  or    percent  at     in midday trade on the new york stock exchange  the shares have been in free  fall for two weeks

new york    business wire    nov       fitch downgrades enron  s outstanding securities as follows  senior unsecured debt to  bbb   from  bbb    subordinated debt to  bb  from  bbb   and preferred stock to  b   from  bbb    enron  s commercial paper has been downgraded to  f   from  f    the senior unsecured debt ratings of its pipeline subsidiaries  northern natural gas co  and transwestern pipeline co   are lowered to  bbb   from  a    all the above securities remain on rating watch negative status  fitch would consider further downgrades if enron were unable to make progress in reducing debt  if its wholesale marketing and trading business were to show signs of material deterioration  or if expenses and charges related to the disposition of non  core businesses and investments exceed present estimations 
today  s rating action reflects the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence  this follows the recognition of a substantial diminution in value of its global merchant investments  which were partly financed with an aggressive use of off  balance sheet vehicles  enron should be able to manage through this challenging environment  ultimately recognizing the values of the company  s core businesses 
in october  enron fully drew down the bulk of its committed bank facilities and paid down outstanding commercial paper  leaving it approximately   billion of cash on hand to support normal business activities  in addition  the company is in the process of executing a new   billion secured bank facility that pledges the assets of northern natural and transwestern  unsecured creditors are structurally subordinated to the secured lenders reducing asset coverage  while its current cash position appears adequate  securing additional capital sources through asset sales or raising additional capital would be a favorable development 
a management priority is debt reduction and the exiting of problem businesses  clearly  these actions  if completed as envisioned will reduce risk and improve the company  s credit profile  however  the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk  particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging market countries  an additional uncertainty is the securities and exchange commission  s  sec  investigation of certain enron sponsored partnerships  the outcome and potential impact of the sec activity is difficult to predict 
the largest announced transaction is the sale of portland general electric co   pge  to northwest natural gas co  the sale appears to be moving ahead as planned and has the favorable support of key local interests  however  the transaction is not expected to close for another year 
enron  s core businesses have continued to generate strong  predictable performance and have significant value  prospectively  operations at enron  s domestic regulated pipelines would be less affected by any lingering uncertainty at enron  also  pge is expected to generate positive and predictable earnings and cash flow over the next year  combined  the pipelines and pge generate nearly   of ebitda  wholesale and retail energy services segments have also consistently reported predictable and growing returns  specifically  commodity marketing and trading activities  which comprise the most profitable and largest part of wholesale operations  have generated steady volume growth and stable unit margins  however  if enron were unable to maintain the support of its counterparties or exhibited diminished financial flexibility  these businesses would be harmed
