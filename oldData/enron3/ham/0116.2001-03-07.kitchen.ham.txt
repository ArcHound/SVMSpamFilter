Subject urgent  pastoria update
water 
we have reached agreement with kern water bank on a detailed term sheet for the backup water supply  azurix has assisted in the process  but will not be part of the definitive agreement  kern water bank says that we can have the definitive agreement done this month  we think it might take longer because they are slow 
calpine negotiations 
 big issue  the condition precedent to closing related to the water agreement  we want to attach the kern water bank term sheet and say that the definitive agreement must be materially similar to the term sheet  calpine will want it to be precise 
 big issue  natural gas transport  we need calpine to commit to taking the transport regardless of what credit support kern requires for the assignment  tycholiz is working with kern to nail that down  kern  s original credit proposal was that they wanted a   mm letter of credit to backstop the transport 
 purchase price adjustment      mm based on water bank deal  minimum gain to enron of   mm plus upside  
 upside  provision in the purchase and sale agreement that allows ena to pursue a contract with dwr and if the price of the contract is greater than    mwh and the implied spark spread from a bona fide gas offer is greater than     based on rockies plus transport   then ena gets     per mwh  this could be worth   mm   
 minor stuff  transition agreement  how we work together and share risk after signing and before closing  development continues  calpine needs to work with ge  site owner  cec  etc 
 timing  expect to sign on march  and close as soon as the water bank deal is done  but no later than april    
natural gas transport 
 march  we must commit to kern expansion capacity for the project  this is very hairy  without the transport  the project can not get gas  the transport without the project is a big potential liability    mm    we are looking at     day for  years  tycholiz is working on this to try to limit the liability by having the project put up a l  c  i dont think kern will accept it  i recommend we commit to the transport with a clear put to calpine concurrent with closing the project sale  if for some reason the project sale to calpine does not close  we will have a permitted ca project with equipment and gas supply  if we wanted to break up the project assets  we would have to remarket the capacity for a potential significant loss 
approvals 
 there are two dashes that are circulating   i  divestiture and  ii  for ongoing development costs and commitment to kern  divestiture dash gives us authority to sell to calpine  the second dash seeks approval for additional development  and the kern transport  rac is still debating over the form of this dash  the daily var estimate on the transport is   mm and with a  day liquidation period  the var is   mm 
enron board of directors 
the second dash requires approval by the executive committee of the ene board  which is scheduled to meet by conference call on monday  march   the three  page presentation for that meeting is due to rebecca carter on friday
