overview
our bankruptcy filing requires a cultural change in the cash management procedures of enron  because of our fiduciary obligation to our creditors  we now must move to centralized cash management  these new procedures will amend our prior policy  as management of the  debtor   we should approach each decision about our business  including cash receipts and disbursements  from the perspective of   does this enhance the value of the debtor  s estate   this memo addresses the new policies that are to be immediately implemented both for entities in the chapter  reorganization and entities that have not filed  there will be a meeting wednesday  december    at    pm in the board room on the  th floor to discuss the new policies 
as a debtor  in  possession   dip    we have new cash flow reporting obligations and we must develop and adhere to a cash flow budget  failure to adhere could have serious consequences to our dip financing availability as well as diminish our credibility with the creditors with whom we must negotiate our ultimate exit from chapter  as a reorganized entity 
all enron business units  not just the ones in bankruptcy  will need to conform to these new requirements because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing  and because it is extremely important for enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the company
