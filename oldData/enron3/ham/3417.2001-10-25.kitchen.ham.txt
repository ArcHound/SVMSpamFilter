the good times are looking even farther away for enron  the company  s inability to extend its energy  trading model to some other commodities is proving increasingly costly  on oct    the nation  s top natural  gas trader and leading wholesale electricity marketer reported a     billion charge  among other things  that covers recent forays into broadband and water trading   as well as the unraveling of a pair of limited partnerships  those partnerships had raised questions about conflicts of interest  until recently  they had been overseen by the company  s cfo  andrew fastow  even though they were outside entities that bought assets from enron  the aftertax charge was one reason the company posted a   million loss in the third quarter  vs  a profit of   million in the year  ago period  without the charge  enron would have shown a profit of   million for the quarter

press release  enron corp outlook now negative by s  p
         new york 
following is a press release from standard  poor  s 
new york  standard  poor  s  oct       standard  poor  s today affirmed
its ratings on enron corp   triple   b   plus   a     and subsidiaries and revised
its long  term ratings outlook to negative due to concerns that the significant
drop in market capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the
company  s financial flexibility and could impede management  s ability to pursue
plans to rebuild its balance sheet   a complete list of ratings is available on
ratingsdirect  standard  poor  s on  line credit research service  or by calling
the standard  poor  s ratings desk at           ratings for portland
general electric co  remain on creditwatch with negative implications pending
the announced acquisition of portland by northwest natural gas co 
enron expects to use asset sales proceeds over the next year to restore its
balance  sheet strength to a level that is consistent with the current ratings 
the negative outlook acknowledges the potential for erosion of the company  s
credit quality as investor confidence in the company  s management has waned and
concerns have arisen about the possible long  term effects on their core
marketing and trading business  standard  poor  s is closely monitoring enron  s
capital needs and liquidity position  which are crucial to the continued
success of its core business operations  and does not believe the company is
threatened by liquidity concerns  enron will be challenged to economically
convert its sizable portfolio of non  strategic assets into cash to reduce debt
and strengthen its balance sheet 
despite the negative outlook  several factors supportive of enron  s credit
quality have been sustained throughout the uncertainty surrounding the company 
the fundamental strength of enron  s energy marketing and trading franchise has
remained steady  standard  poor  s has detected no lapses in the company  s risk
management practices and trading discipline  no significant deterioration in
trading volumes or willingness of counterparties to transact with enron has
been revealed to standard  poor  s in contacts with major energy market
participants 
moreover  the strategic direction of the company is likely to become more
credit  positive in the wake of recent management changes  the prior emphasis on
growth initiatives and the constant need for new capital to fund those
initiatives have constrained credit quality  and if the company is led to
concentrate on its core energy businesses and refrain from committing capital
to more speculative ventures in the future  the credit profile will improve as
the company proceeds with the strengthening of its financial position 
assurances from the top levels of enron management that the company will
maintain its commitment to its credit quality and that no steps are being taken
to support the company  s common stock price at the expense of credit quality
provide further support for enron  s ratings  outlook  negative the negative
outlook for enron is based on the considerable challenges facing the company as
it attempts to reduce balance  sheet leverage through asset dispositions in a
timely manner  any shortfall in the company  s willingness or ability to restore
the balance sheet through sales proceeds and new equity issuances would result
in a ratings downgrade  current ratings will be stabilized if the company can
successfully reduce financial risk while maintaining the ability of its
operations to produce sustainable cash flow and earnings without increasing its
business risk

enron woes fuel online energy trade jitters

by gelu sulugiuc
new york  oct   reuters   enron corp   s  ene  n  almost daily revelations of fresh troubles has prompted concerns its powerful position in online energy trading could prompt a credit crunch and rock the fast  growing industry 
though experts said on thursday that enrononline  enron  s web trading platform  should survive  investors are skittish about the no   u  s  natural gas and electricity marketer 
since last week enron has shed more than   billion in market value as shares plunged  forcing it on wednesday to replace its chief financial officer  who was linked to transactions now under investigation by government regulators 
in the latest blow  credit rating agency fitch on thursday placed enron debt securities on negative credit watch  saying the erosion of investor confidence  if unabated  would impair the company  s access to capital markets
 we put them on a list of concerns two months ago and made sure our books were balanced just as the first stage of precaution   said one energy trader active on enrononline 
about  percent of all transactions by enron are captured through enrononline  and so far traders have kept faith 
on wednesday  enrononline   in which trades always involve enron as either the buyer or seller   conducted    transactions through its site  with a notional value of   billion  more than daily its average of     billion 
 people are transacting at higher levels as they prepare their portfolios for the winter and to protect themselves from price volatility   said vance meyer  an enron spokesman 
runaway success
not even enron itself anticipated the success of enrononline  which enjoys the highest volume of any platform in the cut  throat field of internet energy trade 
initially  the company set a yearly trading volume target of   billion to  billion   business it now does in  days alone 
yet traders worry enron  s spectacular fall from grace could make it a less solid counterparty in certain eyes after transactions with two limited parterships run by andrew fastow sparked investigations by the u  s  securities and exchange commission  enron replaced fastow as its cfe on wednesday in the hope it would restore investor confidence 
enron shares closed down  cents  or    percent  to     on thursday  the stock has lost  percent so far this year 
 i haven  t seen any sign of them slowing down or not making a good market on enrononline  but until things get squared away  i will keep a tight leash on the credit issue   one trader said 
 the only thing that bothers me is it takes a lot of capital to do what they  re doing  and with the stock price down  i wonder how much credit they have left   he added 
credit line
enron said this week that it can tap a     billion credit line to support its trading and marketing business  which can experience wide swings in cash flow depending on commodity prices 
 in the event of a  push  comes  to  shove  liquidity crunch  we believe the company could generate substantial cash by selling a variety of other assets   said ron barone  an analyst at ubs warburg 
if enrononline does lose steam  the big winner will be its main rival atlanta  based  ice    which already routinely trades more than   billion a day 
 this  recent news  shows there may be some kinks in the armor and some people may stop using enrononline   said kyle cooper  analyst at salomon smith barney   clearly ice could benefit or any other alternative online platform  
enrononline is still a force to be reckoned with  experts said   enron clearly will survive and enrononline will still remain a dominant force  in internet energy trading  said barone 
nonetheless  traders are playing it safe 
 credit is the main game nowadays  so as long as you  re not exposed too greatly to any one entity  you live to play another day if something happens   one trader said  reuters
enron  s trading partners say it  s business as usual  correct

trading  said john kilduff  vice president of energy risk
management for fimat usa  it  s also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices 
so far  there are no signs that the houston  based energy
trader  the world  s largest  is doing less business  kilduff said 
  if they were unable to perform  it would be a major
problem    kilduff said    it could get like long  term capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big

exchange commission began asking questions about partnerships he

they fell  cents to     today 
the company also faces questions from investors about
    billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies
formed to buy and sell enron assets such as power plants 
the affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets  enron doesn  t know if the sales
proceeds will cover the debt  the company would have to make good
on any shortfall 
needs cash daily
enron trades electricity  natural gas  coal and other
commodities worldwide  as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods 
  as of now  enron is active in the markets    kilduff said 
  no one is cutting trading lines that i can see  or demanding
different terms than before   
companies that trade as heavily as enron require cash every
day to settle positions  said kilduff  whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with enron 
some days  fimat will bet that natural gas prices will fall 
while enron bets that they will rise  natural gas usually does one
or the other every day  and someone pays the difference 
  the liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor   
kilduff said    someone is paying someone else every day   
enron said on a conference call tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally  and can fall back on     billion in
bank credit lines if necessary  it  s determined to protect the

new york  cbs  mw    shares of enron finished lower for the  th straight session thursday  one day after the energy merchant replaced its chief financial officer in a move the company said should help restore shareholder confidence 
on thursday  fitch placed enron  s securities on watch for a potential downgrade  the company  s credit is already under review by moody  s investors service 
also thursday  chief executive ken lay resigned from the board at i  technologies  citing increasing responsibilities at enron 
enron  which traded as high as     during the session  closed at      down  cents  after  million shares changed hands 
on wednesday  a day after issuing a public vote of confidence in cfo andy fastow  enron chief executive ken lay ousted him in the latest in a two  week series of events that have cut the company  s share price by more than half 
enron named jeff mcmahon its new chief financial officer  the move follows tuesday  s conference call  a failed attempt by enron to restore investor confidence in the company 
 andy fastow was a very well  regarded  low profile individual at enron  and he  s been unfairly pilloried in the press   said john olson  an analyst at sanders morris harris in houston   but the weight of circumstantial evidence and the material stock price decline made this inevitable  
olson predicted wednesday that the cfo swap would improve enron  s credibility with wall street  fastow could not immediately be reached for comment 
analysts unsatisfied
enron has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about its accounting practices  especially in regard to two limited partnerships created by fastow in  and since dissolved 
 fastow was integral to the transactions that are currently under scrutiny    as such  his  leave of absence  raises more questions than it answers   banc of america securities  analyst will maze told clients thursday 
enron said fastow had taken a leave of absence and that mcmahon  most recently chairman and ceo of the industrial markets group and treasurer from  to   would take over 
 in my continued discussions with the financial community  it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo   said lay  in a statement 
karen denne  a spokesperson for enron  said numerous discussions tuesday and wednesday led to the decision  she said she did not know when fastow would return 
 the management change was designed to instill some badly needed investor confidence  however  we find fastow  s departure unsettling given management  s strong endorsement one day prior   maze noted  he downgraded the stock thursday to  market performer  from  strong buy  
morningstar analyst rob plaza said using fastow as a scapegoat does nothing to address the issues at enron 
 enron needs to be more forthcoming with its off  balance  sheet deals and transparent with its financial statements in order to answer its critics   plaza said 
more criticism
olson called tuesday  s conference call a  missed opportunity   saying enron had a real opportunity to show the investing public that it had become more  forthright and open  
 unfortunately enron is overloaded with lawyers   said olson  who has not recommended the stock until recently   this company has been very much abused and maligned by people on wall street  they have some excellent businesses  and they have been carrying some losers   enron has  an excellent growth profile and tremendous profitability in their growth businesses  and excellent surplus cash flow   olson said 
enron expects to generate   billion of cash flow this year  and with   million devoted to dividends and   billion to maintenance capital spending  the company will have     billion free 
several wall street firms cut their ratings on enron shares wednesday  including prudential securities  the firm advised clients to sell the stock  a rare recommendation  prudential had rated the company  s shares a  hold  
 after much consideration  we are lowering our rating    not because of things we know but because of things we potentially don  t know about the company   wrote prudential analyst carol coale in a note 
on monday  enron announced that related  party transactions within the limited partnerships are under review by the securities and exchange commission  several shareholder lawsuits have subsequently been filed 
olson said it  s unlikely that enron  with its coterie of lawyers  would allow the creation of illegal investment vehicles  but as to whether it the decision was  right   he conceded it was probably not 
ubs warburg ron barone on thursday raised the idea of enron as an acquisition target  if further deterioration is seen in the share price 
enron would be a good catch for larger and better  capitalized companies that want to make inroads in the unregulated wholesale and retail energy markets  he said  enron  s strength lies in those areas 
fitch weighs in
fitch said thursday it  s reviewing the ratings on enron  s debt  preferred stock and commercial paper  the agency also placed the debt of two enron subsidiaries on  rating watch negative  
fitch said its action is in response to enron  s recent disclosures concerning the limited partnerships 
 the loss of investor and counterparty confidence  if it continues  would impair enron  s financial flexibility and access to capital markets  therefore  impacting its ability to conduct its business   fitch wrote 
fitch also voiced concern about two limited liability companies  marlin water trust ii and osprey  which have combined debt of     billion 
 enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt   fitch said 
denne said the company plans to use proceeds from asset sales to pay off the debt

new york  ap   selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled the stock market higher thursday  reversing a morning slide triggered by a pair of grim economic reports 
shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly well  as did energy traders  led by a surprisingly strong performance from williams cos   a tulsa  based energy firm that had an  percent jump in third quarter net earnings 
by late afternoon  the dow jones industrial average was up    at       reversing an earlier deficit of  points  the nasdaq composite index was up    at      and the standard  poor  s  index was up    to      
earlier  a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the fallout from last month  s terror attacks to send stocks lower  but as in recent sessions investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good news regarding individual companies 
the williams cos  surpassed analysts  estimates for the third quarter and raised its forecasts for full  year earnings for  and   investors rewarded the company by driving its shares up     to      bringing several other parts of the energy sector along with it 
even the shares of enron rose  a day after the embattled company dismissed its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from within the company  enron was up  cents to     
semiconductor shares also rebounded  led by industry bellwether intel  up  cents at     and applied materials  up     at     leading data storage maker emc was also up     at     
traders said that afternoon passage by the senate of an anti  terrorism legislation was also helping to lift investor sentiment  late wednesday  the house passed a   billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrorist attacks on the economy 
a surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily on the market in the morning  as did poor earnings results from american international group and worldcom 
the commerce department reported orders plunged in september for the fourth consecutive month  the    percent decline was far worse than the    percent dip many analysts had forecast 
the labor department also reported that the number of newly laid  off americans filing for unemployment benefits rose by    last week to     the second  highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally associated with recessions 
the russell  index  the barometer of smaller company stocks  rose    to    
advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a   to   margin on the new york stock exchange  where volume came to    billion shares  slightly below wednesday  s pace 
overseas  japan  s nikkei stock average ended the day up    percent  in afternoon trading  germany  s dax index was down    percent  france  s cac   fell    percent percent  and britain  s ft  se  declined    percent

absence  and named jeff mcmahon to take his place 
 graphic  enron names jeff mcmahon new cfo 
now the company says it did this in order to restore
investor confidence  that  s no surprise  well the stock
has plummeted ever since reports said that the cfo had
invested in controversial partnerships and the sec is
inquiring into those partnerships that were led by andrew
fastow   graphic  enron  ene  down   last   weeks 
now  you can see what  s happened to the stock over the last
two weeks  a tailspin since its third  quarter earnings
release and the sec inquiry  but if you look at it over
the past year  it  s down even more  down eighty percent 
 graphic  enron  ene  down   year  to  date  it was just
a few months ago in august when the ceo jeff skilling
suddenly resigned and other senior managers had left the
company even before that 
the steps that were taken by rena   putting a new cfo on the
spot  re   ron baron    an analyst at ubs warburg says it  s
a step in the right direction   graphic  enron  ene  up
  in   but carole cole    over at prudential says
sell  and she says it  s because of the things we don  t
know about the company 
what we do know about the company is that the stock was up
eighty  seven percent in the year   it was a wall
street darling back then  it was basically an old  economy
pipeline that was transformed into a new  economy company
with pipes of fiber  yes  the company got into online
wholesale trading of energy products and into the broadband
business  it formed a sexy partnership with blockbuster
video in which it would basically stream bought
blockbuster  s videos into the home using its own fibers
 sic   that deal fell apart  and then later on  the tech
boom went bust and this stock that used to trade like a
tech stock went south 
now here are some of the issues that are facing the
company  one  it   there are    billion dollars in notes
that are due in the next twenty months  now according to
the wall street journal  the company thinks it can pay them
back without having to issue new stocks  some analysts
think otherwise  is the company overly diversified  it  s
in businesses such as broadband  which by the way extended
its losses to eighty million dollars in the third quarter
from twenty million last year  and it  s in the water and
waste water company in the company xurex     it  s facing
an sec inquiry  an inquiry that prudential  s carole cole
says could lead to probes of other partnerships
transactions  and if other partnerships end up being
dissolved  the company could face a stock hit of at least
one billion dollars  finally  the company faces lower
energy prices on power and gas  so customers are trying to
renegotiate their contracts so they can get a better deal

for credit suisse first boston  he joins us now from the
firm  s new york office 
curt  thanks for being here 
curt launer  credit suisse first boston   good afternoon 
thank you 
velshi  curt  i  m just looking at   at some of the   the
chart stuff on enron  i mean  this stock was in a sixty to
eighty  dollar band from february of  almost for more
than a year until may of this year  even this year  s
fifty  two  week range about seventeen dollars to eighty  five
dollars  now trading at   from fifteen dollars to
eighty  five dollars  now trading about sixteen dollars and
change  what are your thoughts on the stock  s performance 
launer  well clearly it  s had a horrific decline and there
are a lot of reasons behind it  just the way that it was
probably unreal for a lot of reasons for enron to trade at
fifty times earnings a little bit more than a year ago  i
think it  s equally unreal for it to be trading at about
eight times earnings right now  that was an
everything  going  right scenario a year and a little bit
ago  the scenario we have right now is the one that says
the price is telling us everything is going to go wrong  i
didn  t think that everything was going to go right  nor do
i think that everything is going to go wrong at this point 
katayama  curt  what should the company do about
broadband  i mean  that was highly touted a year ago 
it  s losses are mounting  demand is weakening 
launer  broadband is really not part of the story very
much anymore  part of the write  offs taken with enron
during the third  quarter earnings report that you referred
to before really got the company to a level where the
broadband investment on the books is very  very small 
there probably are some additional tag  in write  offs that
could be taken in the broadband business  but in large
measure  the bro   broadband portion of the business for
bandwidth trading has been moved into enron  s wholesale
business and the content services business  which was at
one time high flying with that blockbuster deal  has
basically been dismantled 
kiernan  curt  has the company addressed the problems here
in the past twenty  four hours  i mean  are they building
some credibility back with investors 
launer  i   it  s going to be a long stretch before they
build what i would call real credibility back   graphic 
enron  ene     up    but you  ve got to start
somewhere  the placing of the leave of absence of andy
fastow is a step of the right direction  clearly he had
lost his credibility personally  there  s a lot of
questions remaining relative to these partnerships  how
they were put in place and why  i don  t see anything
untoward in them from an accounting point of view  and i
don  t believe that the sec inquiry is going to come up with
anything untoward because there  s been extensive reporting
about these partnerships over the last couple of years that
they  ve been in existence  the questions come up now
because of the financial ramifications that you referred to
before     billion dollars of asset value that to some
degree is unaccounted for currently in terms of the assets
that are in those partnerships 
ultimately  we think this is going to be resolved  perhaps
partially with the issuance of some equity that   to the
debt holders behind those partnerships  but once they get
cleared up and the credibility is restored  this is a very
attractive valuation with which to own enron 
velshi  all right  curt  thanks very much for joining us
