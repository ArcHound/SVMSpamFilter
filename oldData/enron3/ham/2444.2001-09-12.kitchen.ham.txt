 i am having trouble responding to email remotely  regarding your question
 about progress on cgas  we have initiated the third party engineering
 review process required under the brazos facility  indications are that
 it will be completed before september   other due diligence has
 commenced as well  a marketing brochure has been drafted and should be
 complete in the next two weeks  john thompson has a meeting scheduled for
 next week with the existing prospective buyer to determine if the buyer is
 going to close the proposed transaction  i will keep you posted  i can
 be reached at mariner
