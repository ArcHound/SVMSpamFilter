Subject oppd prepayment
 terri did the deal for     million gain to enron 
 above profit was negotiated based on   million up  front payment 
 for income smoothing reasons  oppd asked to defer the payment  which we agreed to do 
 oppd also asked to retain the option for early payment in the event their circumstances changed  we agreed to do this  but also negotiated the libor discount 
i  e   they gave us the potential time value for free  but have now exercised their option  therefore we have only had the free time value for    months  instead of   ish
