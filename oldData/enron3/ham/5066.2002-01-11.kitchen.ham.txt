Subject eol gas documents
we have determined  vickers and tycholiz and hodge  that no interruptible gas is transacted on line  but certain firm gas descriptions excuse performance on the basis of normal pipeline constraints  without liability   therefore  for phase  rollout no eol interruptible  spot gtc is needed  in phase  they may consider adding some interruptible products on line  they do want an over the counter interruptible gtc  which will be prepared  in any event  all eol physical gas will be sold online in phase  under the firm gtc  until masters are signed   the phase  eol decision tree will then be if gisb master signed  up to  day firm gas under gisb  over  under firm gtc  if firm master signed  all gas under firm master
