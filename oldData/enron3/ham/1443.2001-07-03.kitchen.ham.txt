title  brazilian power markets  prices hit maximum as rationing plan begins

southern cone power report  brazilian crisis deepens but voluntary
conservation is strong   for now
on june   brazil implemented the first phase of a voluntary rationing plan 
including consumption quotas for each consumer class  in an effort to avoid
rolling blackouts later in the year  demand grew strongly in the first months
of the year  but recent evidence suggests that the voluntary conservation
scheme was largely successful in june  thermal generation has also increased
significantly  but new thermal power plants will not be online until after the
next rainy season begins 
 southeast hydro reservoirs fell to    percent of maximum by june   while
northeast reservoir levels were just    percent of maximum 
 conservation will have to be deep and sustained for many months to achieve
the needed demand reduction 
 government initiatives to promote new generation capacity may have serious
long  term implications for the development of a competitive power
market
