Subject fw  service bureau prohibitions
hi louise  jay
if you can help shed any light on your vendor relationship with legato
and rational  and whether you believe there is scope for reviewing
these licenses with a view to changing the relevant license agreements 
that would be extremely helpful  we understand that both these
products would be critical components to running the netco systems 
thx

 steve and roger 

 we are reviewing a sampling of third party software licenses e
 company entered and seem to have found two licenses not
 previously noted by e company as containing an express
 prohibition on use as part of a service bureau  as i discussed
 with roger briefly yesterday  this we assume is as much an issue
 for you as it would be for us because operation of the it on a
 service bureau basis initially is a key mutual expectation 
 both licenses are listed on your draft schedule     f   i  to the
 contribution agreement so i  m guessing they are material to the
 business and the relevant software would have to be operated for
 u company  s benefit  u company hasn  t spoken to any e company
 it personnel to learn the significance of the affected software 
 but ursula mills is planning to raise the question with jay webb
 or another appropriate person 

the two licenses are 
  enterprise software license agreement between legato
systems  inc  and  e  corp  dated as of sept      respecting
numerous software products generally branded with the names
networker  gems  celestra  octopus and others  section   
provides   restrictions on use  licensee shall not  and shall
not aid  abet or permit any third party to      iii     use
for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use   
the software    for the benefit of third parties     
  products license agreement   modified for  e 
corp  issued by ration software corp   dated as of feb     
respecting various software products branded clearcase  rational 
purify  and quantify and others  section    provides   general
grant of license     you may not rent  lease or use the product
in a service bureau capacity      
we continue to review the agreements for the service
bureau issue as it is the most pressing from a time perspective 
we have already found several ambiguous licenses and will bring
those to your attention as a group later 
if other express provisions such as the above turn up  i
will let you know on a case by case basis as this issue is one our
it personnel are taking seriously
