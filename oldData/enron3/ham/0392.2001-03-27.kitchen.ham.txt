louise  some news and views for yourself on this credit 
hedging this name for any duration past  years is all but impossible at present 
insurance companies will write protection  with   first loss being taken by ene  but proof of loss must exist and all covents must be adhered to otherwise payout can be made void  believe the offering you have from zurich should be used to cover first  mil of  mil exposure at the front end  this is the cheapest alternative but does come with certain hindrances  ie timeliness of payments and proof of loss  an additional constraint here is the bb or better private rating ene must get for deacero 
what enroncredit can offer is to hedge the excess exposure above the insurance coverage  we would cover failure to pay and bankruptcy of said name  we would offer protection in either a  or  year rolling tranche format  protection can either be bought for the duration   yrs npv  at      cash settlement  louise you get paid out   recovery  of financial assets   payout   or on a rolling basis at  bpts over where enroncreit hedges itself in the market  expect to get  yr protection off at   per annum at present   we have the ability to structure this tranche on an accreting or amortising basis to either suit the p  or actual exposures  payment can be made digital  cost would be stated cost         expected recovery   
louise if you want to call me today to discuss i will be in till    london time 
bill  we would hedge out the credit exposure on a ltol basis and run the duration risk  require permission from yourself to run  manage this risk
