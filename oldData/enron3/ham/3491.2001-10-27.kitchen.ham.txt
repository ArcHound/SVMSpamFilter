good question  i think he has experience using other people  s money to get asset deals done  worth asking  answer probably depends on a gut feel on how we answer the questions 
is something changing that increases the number of potential counterparties 
is something changing that increases the number of products  risks that we can intermediate 
if answer is yes  perhaps we just need more good mid  marketers 
if answer is no  maybe we need someone that can look at bigger regional issues  infrastructure  cross  border basis  etc 
have him based in houston and go for it for  months  if nothing materializes  it  s a small investment for a large  neighboring country
