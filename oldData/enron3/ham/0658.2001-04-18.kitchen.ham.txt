Subject fw  enron  abb meeting
team 
abb will be here on thursday  april  at    am  my recommendation is that ozzie and i start out with them and perhaps pull louise in at some point to show the flag  scott  we  ll pull you in before we make any scheduling or engineering decisions  so if you could remain flexible for that period it would be greatly appreciated 
steph  if you could please get us a room through lunch at least  thanks

drew 
i spoke with svante this am and he and lars would like to visit with you and the
team on thursday  april     am  i think that they plan to fly in wed 
evening  i will pick them up at the airport and take them to dinner 
we will come to your offices to discuss where the project is at this time  where
enron expects it to go  what we can do to continue to support your efforts  we
will look at options that are beneficial to both enron and abb regarding
schedule  whatever that may be in the future considering work load for all
concerned  we will also will discuss some method  even a handshake  to keep the
contract in place so that we do not have to go through a negotiation next time 
please let us know if there are any other issues that you would like to discuss 
we will be prepared  look forward to seeing you then 
mike
