new plans
in the late  s  enron executives changed course  the
company said that it would sell pipelines and power plants to make
money almost entirely from trading energy  rather than producing
it  the plan succeeded  last year   percent of enron  s revenue
came from trading and advising industrial customers on energy use 
  i think our legacy will be that we proved you can build a
business on intellectual capital  not physical assets    former
chief executive officer jeffrey skilling said in may  skilling
left enron in august  citing personal reasons  and was replaced by
his predecessor  kenneth lay 
central to the enron plan to sell its hardware was the
creation of affiliates to buy the pipelines and plants  and to
sell bonds to finance the transactions  enron posted information
on its web site last week saying it had created affiliates to
raise money for enron projects 
officials involved
incorporation papers in texas and delaware show that the 
companies formed by enron list enron executives or employees as
officers  fastow served as an officer or director for all 
affiliates 
one enron affiliate  obi   holdings llc  lists  enron
employees and executives as directors  another affiliate  oilfield
business investments   llc  lists  
enron spokesman mark palmer has said the executives served as
officers and directors of the affiliates only to represent enron  s
interests  none of them receives any compensation except fastow 
he said  fastow was permitted by enron to earn a bonus of 
percent of the total amount one partnership invested 
selling assets to company  controlled affiliates isn  t
uncommon  said columbia university securities law professor john
coffee    it  s not suspect by itself    coffee said    companies
do it to make balance sheets look better   
the practice isn  t embraced by everyone 
  that sort of thing wouldn  t be part of duke  s business
plan    said jim donnell  chief executive of duke energy corp   s
wholesale power unit    you have a different objective if you sell
to an interested special purpose vehicle   
profit potential
earlier this year  former cfo fastow was in an unusual
position  enron  s board permitted him to manage two partnerships 
ljm cayman and ljm  co  investment  and personally profit from
buying and selling assets  ljm entered into agreements that bound
it to buy enron stock at a predetermined price six months later 
a lawsuit filed by shareholder fred greenberg says fastow
used advance knowledge that enron shares would fall to rework the
agreement  that allowed ljm to buy the shares two months early 
bringing     million in profit  if the agreement hadn  t been
renegotiated  the partnership would have lost money  the suit
alleges 
enron has acknowledged potential conflict of interest by
allowing executives to serve as directors of affiliates  a bond
offering for the whitewing affiliate says   certain individuals
that serve as officers and directors of enron may also serve as
directors of whitewing    therefore  the duties of the
directors and officers of enron may conflict with the duties of
the directors and officers of whitewing   
ouster
enron ousted fastow as cfo on oct    the day after the
company said the sec had questions about the partnerships 
shareholders also say in lawsuits that enron executives
benefited from not fully disclosing the company  s financial
position  they cite insider sales of   million in shares ahead
of a  percent drop in the company  s stock in february and march 
the executives included lay  who sold stock worth    
million  skilling  who sold stock for     million  and vice
chairman mark frevert  who sold shares totaling     million 
  this trading was unusual and suspicious given its timing   
a shareholder class  action suit says    they had access to
adverse  undisclosed information

whether those contacts will need to be tapped as enron struggles through a corporate crisis touched off by questionable financial dealings remains to be seen  but companies usually give money to candidates so they will have friends in high places when they need them  experts said 
  enron  will probably have to use a lot of their goodwill  that  s what they build it up for anyway   said energy analyst dale steffes  head of planning and forecasting consultants in houston 
enron  which dominates natural gas and electricity markets in the united states  has come under investigation by the u  s  securities and exchange commission following disclosures that it did off  balance sheet deals with partnerships run by then  chief financial officer andrew fastow 
the financial world  concerned about possible conflicts of interest and angry that enron has yet to explain what transpired  has abandoned the stock in recent weeks  causing a  percent drop in value since mid  october 
enron  trying to bolster investor confidence  has tapped more than   billion in new and existing credit lines in recent days  but its credit rating has been cut to near junk status over worries about a possible cash crunch 
political capital high
no such problems afflict enron on the political side 
lay is a long time political benefactor of the bush family and is believed by some experts to be the biggest single contributor to george w  bush  s various campaigns 
last year  lay earned the title of bush  pioneer  for having raised at least     in contributions to the presidential campaign  by some estimates  he has given about   million to bush over the years 
lay has said his political contributions are not aimed at gaining influence 
 when i make contributions to a candidate  it  s not for some special favor    it  s because i  m supporting a candidate i strongly believe in personally   lay said in an interview on pbs  news program  frontline  
when bush was governor of texas  lay served on his governor  s business council  which helped push the bush legislative agenda  and he was a key energy adviser during the presidential campaign 
lay came under criticism when he was one of a handful of business bigwigs called in for a private meeting with cheney as the administration formulated its controversial energy plan 
 ken  s been a friend   cheney explained to frontline 
enron  s network of political connections extends into congress where it gives money to many in the house and senate 
according to the center for responsive politics  which tracks money in politics  enron and its employees gave     million in contributions in the  election year  more than than any other energy company 
of that amount   percent went to republicans  said the washington  based center 
its ties to u  s  senator phil gramm of texas  the ranking republican on the powerful senate banking committee  are particularly close because his wife  wendy gramm  is on enron  s board of directors 
from  to   under then president george h  w  bush  she chaired the u  s  commodity futures trading commission  which played a role in deregulating energy markets that enron now dominates  she raised eyebrows when she joined enron  s board just five weeks after leaving the commission 
gramm  s selection was not all that unusual for enron  said andrew wheat  research director for texans for public justice  a campaign finance watchdog group in austin 
he told reuters the company has used former washington officials to help secure business deals here and in other countries  last week  enron hired william mclucas  a former head of the sec  s enforcement division  as its attorney in the probe into its business dealings 
 i think enron has astronomical power  both in this state and in this country    and with bush  they are unparalleled   wheat said 
still no guarantees
steffes said that enron  s connections do not guarantee washington  s help if the company needs some kind of bailout   the energy industry is just not that well liked   he said 
more likely  he believes  is that energy industry peers would chip in by taking a financial interest in the company simply because they need enron  experts worry that without enron  which controls about  percent of energy trading  the markets would become too volatile 
but wheat said the idea that enron is  too big to fail  is not likely to be lost on an administration that  following the attacks on sept    engineered a bailout of the airlines and may do the same for other industries 
and enron comes with a big advantage  he said 
 it  s got a pretty clear path to the white house   wheat said

usa  update   enron shares hit new lows on credit worries

houston  nov   reuters   enron corp  shares sank below the   mark for the first time in almost a decade on tuesday  amid persistent concerns the beleaguered energy giant  s deteriorating credit ratings could hamper its core natural gas and electricity marketing and trading business 
in afternoon trading  enron  s stock was down      or    percent  at     per share  after hitting a new nine  year low of      enron was the most actively traded issue on the new york stock exchange on tuesday  with more than  million shares changing hands  and the fourth  biggest percentage loser 
so far this year  shares of the former wall street favorite have lost  percent of their value  the stock last traded below   in may  
 you  re seeing continuing concern over their credit rating   said cibc world markets analyst william hyler 
its stock was hammered particularly hard as concerns about its complex finances and a lack of disclosure undermined investor confidence in enron following its release of third  quarter earnings 
the stock plunge began after oct    when enron reported its first quarterly loss in four years  took a   billion charge for ill  fated investments and soon after disclosed a     billion cut in shareholder equity 
an investigation by the u  s  securities and exchange commission into dealings related to chief financial officer andrew fastow further undermined investor confidence  and led to fastow  s ouster 
share prices tried to rebound last week  but renewed their plunge after an announcement on monday by credit rating agency fitch that it had cut its rating for enron  s senior unsecured debt to one notch above junk  bond status  fitch also said it would make further downgrades if enron were unable to make progress in reducing debt 
the other two main rating agencies  moody  s investors service and standard  poor  s  had already cut their credit ratings for enron 
enron is north america  s biggest marketer and trader of electricity and natural gas  but analysts say that holding on to investment  grade credit ratings is vital to maintaining the confidence of the companies that it trades with each day 
traders in both markets said on tuesday that they are monitoring enron closely but that there are no signs of anybody cutting back on their business with the company for fear that it might not be able to honor its obligations 
as part of ongoing efforts to strengthen its finances and restore confidence  enron has held talks with private equity firms and power  trading companies about a capital injection of at least   billion  the wall street journal reported on tuesday 
investors willing to provide fresh capital to enron would receive an equity stake in enron or preferred stock that would be convertible into common stock if enron  s stock price recovers to a certain level  the journal said 
hyler said it was difficult to judge whether this would be welcomed by existing investors who could see their existing ownership stake in enron diluted by such a move 
 it depends on the cost of that equity and how much they have to give up   he said 
another analyst  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said short  term  rather than long  term financing is currently uppermost in most investors  minds 
 can they get to a permanent solution or do they have to fold in the light of short  term credit worries   he said
