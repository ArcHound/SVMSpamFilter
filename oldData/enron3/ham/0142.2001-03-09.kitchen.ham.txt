enron you
i do not have a specific agenda or client list yet  will send as soon as available 
starting mid afternoon  time to be confirmed  likely between  and      merrill will set up  separate conference rooms with a company in each conference room  they will rotate  clients from room to room every  minutes to    hour to meet with each company executive and ir person  they would like each company to put together no more than  slides with their strategy  focusing on distinctions  the sessions will be informal  allowing the firms to ask specific company  related questions 
donato has been a long  time sailor and has a   foot boat  at    p  m  they will take the boat to the aquarium  you can also drive to the aquarium   mins    dinner will be at    and this should be done by    p  m  at that time they will board the boat again back to south shore harbor  whoever decided to drive to dinner can leave at that time  might be a reasonable alternative for someone in late stage pregnancy   
we don  t often ask mgmt  to give up an evening when in houston  but this event is important to merrill  i expect the to  firms represented to be worthwhile  i very much appreciate your availability  will be in touch with more specifics 
thanks  paula
