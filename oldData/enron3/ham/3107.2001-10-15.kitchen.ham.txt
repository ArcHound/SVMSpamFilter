subject  ecp  linden swaps
here  s my understanding of what has happened with the interest rate swaps 
as i indicated earlier  the original   mm was put on for the linden  expansion which never occurred 
the second swap of   mm was put on to protect the value of the cash flow from el paso assuming we would monetize the asset shortly  this hedge does appear to have been set with the el paso payment stream in mind 
the original   mm of swaps did not provide a clean hedge to the remaining el paso cash flows as they were  year bullets while the el paso payment stream is a  year monthly amortizer 
however  the   mm of hedges did approximate notionally the asset to be hedged 
it appears that given the assumption the swaps were to have been monetized in a short period of time  a decision may have been made that unwinding and rewinding the  dirty  interest rate hedge was more expensive than wearing the basis risk for a brief time 
given that the monetization never occurred  it does appear to me that the   mm hedge is ineffective and should be removed or replaced if we determine that we should hedge the rate risk associated with the note 
anyone have anything additional to add  that  s the best i could turn up looking back after the fact given the many personnel departures
