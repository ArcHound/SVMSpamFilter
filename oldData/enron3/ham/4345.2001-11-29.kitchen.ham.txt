uk  enron threatens double hit to credit tool market

london  nov   reuters   the credit derivatives market faced a double threat from troubled u  s  energy trader enron on thursday  leaving dealers divided on whether the rapid growth of the market might be at risk 
enron  s troubles impact the market through credit derivatives contracts written on the company  which would be triggered if it files for bankruptcy protection  and through deals transacted by its enron credit subsidiary  which specialised in trading credit protection on third parties 
credit derivatives are insurance  like tools that allow investors to hedge or gain the risk of an issuer defaulting on a loan or bond  default swaps  the most liquid type of credit derivative  involve the buyer paying the protection seller an annual premium  measured in basis points 
accountants said they had been appointed administrator to enron  s european division on thursday  some dealers predicted that if enron goes under  the credit derivative contracts on enron and entered into by enron would be unwound in an orderly way 
 it will be another good example of how the market does work    it will regain people  s confidence in the market   said guy america  vice president for credit derivatives at j  p  morgan chase in london 
image problem
however  other dealers predicted a messy conclusion 
 the impact is clearly a loss of confidence in the credit derivative market overall   said a default swaps trader with a european bank 
the most recent corporate failure to trigger a large number of default swaps  that of u  k  rail operator railtrack  resulted in banks calling in lawyers to see if they had to pay out on certain obligations 
dealers said enron was an actively traded name in the default swaps market  mainly in new york  as a privately negotiated market  it is difficult to get accurate figures for the value of contracts outstanding on enron  however  dealers said well over a billion dollars of protection on enron had been written 
  it was  one of the benchmark names for the us credit  derivative market     so you can guess that a lot of people were involved in this credit through default swaps   said the european bank trader 
uncertain credit insurance
potentially more damaging for the credit derivatives market is the failure of enron credit  the subsidiary specialised in selling credit risk mitigation tools to companies who wanted to hedge against customers going bankrupt and failing to pay 
if end  users now find the derivatives they bought no longer give them the level of credit protection they expected  it may make it harder for banks in future to convince more of their customers to start using the tools 
on the back of demand from end  users  enron credit was active in the inter  dealer default swaps market  a filing for bankruptcy by enron corp  could trigger settlement on all the contracts into which enron credit entered 
this would involve a large number of contracts and dealers say this would be concentrated among the limited circle of banks  mainly enron corp  s bank lenders  which accepted enron credit as a dealing counterparty 
 it was not broadly accepted as a counterparty   said one dealer  who added that he hadn  t seen the firm in the market since october 
lenders face biggest loss
however  most dealers concur that any losses the banks might incur on credit derivatives contracts would be small compared to potential lending losses 
 counterparty losses would be dwarfed by direct lending exposure   said the head of credit derivatives at a euroepan bank 
dealers said some banks had looked at taking on the enron credit trading book but that this now looked unlikely 
 the banks that were involved in trying to rescue the bank recently   were also involved in overlooking their credit book and potentially making a bid to take it into their own book   said one trader 
shares in enron fell  percent to  cents after a rescue deal by smaller rival dynegy inc fell apart on wednesday  on thursday the company said it may not pay previously declared dividends

new york  nov   reuters   stocks are set to open flat to slightly higher on thursday following some upbeat corporate outlooks  but mixed economic data and the aftermath of the near  collapse of energy trader enron corp  could affect trading 
enron  teetering on the brink of one of the biggest corporate implosions in u  s  history  plunged  percent in frenzied trading wednesday  it dragged on the market as investors also sold amid worry that a rally from sept   lows reached in the wake of the attacks on the united states was overdone 
 the enron collapse may have significant ramifications on banks and other energy companies where contracts with enron may now not be honored  and the enron equity may be worthless   said alan ackerman  market strategist with brokerage fahnestock  co 
equity index futures were up but at one point off earlier highs after the release of data at    a  m    gmt  that showed a rise in jobless claims but also a rise in durable goods orders 
 there was a mixed response  we saw an encouraging number in the durable goods but it  s too early to see this as a sustained trend up and layoffs continue to be a real concern   ackerman added 
the number of americans lining up for first  time jobless benefits rose by    last week  exceeding wall street expectations and showed continued weakening in the u  s  labor market  the data showed the number of so  called continued claims rose by    to    million for the week ended nov    the biggest one  week increase in  years 
orders for costly u  s  durable goods surged at the fastest rate on record in october by    percent to     billion  led by huge increases in orders for aircraft and defense capital goods  the data may help rekindle hopes that the economy has rebounded since the sept   attacks 
equity index futures suggested a largely flat to slightly higher open  december futures for the s  p  index rose    points to      while futures for the nasdaq  added  points to     futures for the dow jones industrials gained  points at    
other indicators flagged a mildly higher open  the indicative dow jones industrial average  which is based on prices of dow stocks trading in germany  s deutsche boerse u  s  market segment  rose    points  or    percent  to      
the nasdaq   premarket indicator was up    points  or    percent  based on trading ahead of the open in the tech  heavy index  s biggest stocks 
hand  held computer maker palm inc  rose in extended  hours trading on wednesday and pre  open trade on thursday after the company said it expects to meet estimates  palm rose to     pre  open from its nasdaq close of     
storage networking company brocade communications systems inc  rose to     ahead of the open from a close at      the company reported quarterly operating profits fell sharply as the slower economy kept many corporate buyers on the sidelines  although the results beat wall street forecasts 
enron  which finished at  cents on wednesday  was a little higher in pre  open trading  at  cents  enron sank wednesday after rival dynegy inc  pulled out of its planned   billion takeover of the beleaguered energy trader  credit rating agencies slashed enron  s bonds to junk status and shoved the once mighty company another step closer to bankruptcy 
enron squeezed other energy traders and financial giants citigroup inc  and jp morgan chase  co  inc   which may suffer losses of more than   million combined on their lending to the energy trading group  according to at least one analyst 
on wednesday  the blue  chip dow jones industrial average surrendered    points  or    percent  to       the largest drop in about a month and the lowest close since nov    the broader standard  poor  s  index slid    points  or    percent  to       the technology  laced nasdaq composite index dropped  points  or    percent  to

uk  enron europe not seen in default on energy trade

london  nov   reuters   beleaguered u  s  energy trader enron so far has not defaulted on any of its over  the  counter energy swap contracts in europe  dealers said on thursday  but many in the trading community have arranged alternative trades to cover their exposure as news emerged that enron had sought protection from its creditors and appointed accountant as administrator 
enron stands on the brink of bankruptcy after a rescue deal with its smaller rival dynegy fell apart on wednesday  the company halted trading on its enrononline platform on the same day 
 they haven  t had any defaults yet  but nobody  s trading with them at the moment   a dealer at a major oil company which had trading links with enron said 
dealers said enron had been missing from the european oil otc market for over a week and many companies had stopped trading with them a month ago as signs emerged of financial difficulties at america  s largest energy trader 
in the oil market  enron  s trading activities extended right across the petroleum product chain as well as various brent crude derivatives contracts 
they said the dated to front line  dfl  brent contract  which balances the risk of dated brent against the front  month ipe futures contract  had seen substantial activity on thursday amid speculation that some players had moved to square off their positions against exposures to enron 
 it  s a case of closing up positions   a brent trader said 
dealers said enron was believed to have closed positions on london  s international petroleum exchange  the ipe declined comment 
the dealers said a shortlived price spike late on wednesday on ipe and nymex crude oil and nymex natural gas futures markets suggested a brief session of short covering 
 there was a short spell when the natural gas market was strengthening and wti moved up  one broker was doing most of the buying and most people thought he was covering for enron  but the market came straight back down   said one futures dealer 
an spokeswoman for the ipe said its compliance department was looking at enron  s positions on the market and had been talking with financial services authority and clearing house 
 we will be able to maintain the integrity of the market   the spokeswoman said

new york   dow jones   salomon smith barney analyst guy moszkowski said the troubles at enron corp   ene  will not have a material impact on brokerage firms  credit and counterparty energy trading exposure 
in a research note thursday  moszkowski said the credit exposure to enron among the larger securities firms  morgan stanley  mwd   merrill lynch  co   mer   goldman sachs group inc   gs   bear stearns cos   bsc  and lehman brothers holdings inc   leh   is minimal and is largely hedged where it exists 
among the larger brokers  only morgan stanley and goldman sachs have  meaningful  operations in energy trading  moszkowski said 
 against the backdrop of significantly improved risk management procedures in the industry  we believe exposure to enron has been curtailed for some time now  particularly as concern regarding the firm  s credit worthiness is hardly a new development   moszkowski said   however  given the sophistication and complexity of energy contracts  we believe it is fair to assume there will be some  albeit likely limited and  ultimately  immaterial  counterparty exposure at both goldman sachs and morgan stanley

dollar under pressure on u  s  economic woes  enron situation

dow jones newswires
new york   the dollar was under pressure thursday  weighed down by a combination of the federal reserve  s somber outlook for the u  s  economy  waning u  s  consumer confidence and concerns about the financial woes of enron corp 
in morning new york trading  the euro was at    u  s  cents  up from    cents late wednesday in new york  the dollar was at    yen  little changed from    yen late wednesday 
the greenback was also at    swiss francs  compared with     while sterling was trading at      down slightly from     late wednesday 
the dollar managed to get a brief respite from u  s  durable goods data for october  which showed orders for big ticket items sharply rebounded by a record amount  more than reversing september  s large drop 
but the overall tone for the dollar remains weak  amid a growing sense that the u  s  might not be able to rebound from recession as fast as previously thought 
 the dollar is a little heavy across the board   said robert sinche  head of global currency strategy at citibank in new york   unless you get something completely outrageous  it looks likely to remain that way  
the dollar has fallen below key support levels against both the euro and the yen  as traders moved to liquidate a spate of long dollar positions 
while the enron situation doesn  t have a direct effect on foreign exchange markets  analysts said that it wasn  t helping dollar sentiment 
 the market was ripe for an unwinding of long dollar positions   said mr  sinche   enron    is the kind of situation that just acts as a catalyst  
as is often the case  the euro  s gains appeared to be more a result of pessimism towards the u  s  rather than any optimism about the euro zone 
the market largely shrugged off third quarter euro  zone gross domestic product data earlier thursday which came in exactly as expected  up     on the quarter and     on the year 
the dollar  s direction thursday will also be influenced by u  s  shares  with prospects for a marked rebound looking slim in the wake of the enron woes 
analysts said a sustained move above the  cent level could set the euro up for a test of    cents and then  cents  which is expected to offer more formidable resistance 
its difficulty in making a concerted push for  cents is probably down to the potential outflows related to the morgan stanley capital international indexes rebalancing  and the deutsche telekom  voicestream deal 
the first phase of the new msci weightings comes into effect friday  and should involve fund managers reducing their exposure to euro zone equities 
so far  this seems to have been discounted  although it could still help to keep a lid on the euro 
the lockup period for voicestream shareholders to keep hold of their deutsche telekom shares expires dec    which could prompt them to offload the stock  in effect resulting in sizable euro  zone outflows 
benign inflation data from switzerland out earlier thursday  up only     in november on the year  has paved the way for the swiss national bank to cut interest rates at its next meeting dec   
 with the market looking only for a rate cut of  basis points  we would expect the swiss franc to remain capped around current levels   said ubs warburg analysts

charlotte  n  c   nov    prnewswire    duke energy  nyse  duk  today expressed confidence in the vitality of the energy sector and said it had taken steps to manage its exposure during the very serious difficulties being experienced by enron  including instituting a trading halt 
 although we didn  t completely cease trading with enron until yesterday  in the course of our normal credit practices  we took steps to limit our exposure to enron  we currently have approximately   million in non  collaterized exposure to enron  we are closely monitoring this unfortunate situation to determine if a provision against earnings is appropriate   said richard j  osborne  executive vice president and chief risk officer for duke energy 
osborne was referring to dynegy  s announcement that it is terminating the merger agreement with enron and the decision by major rating agencies to downgrade enron  s long  term debt below investment grade 
 the market is larger than any one player and is very resilient  enron  s role and activities in the energy market have significantly diminished over the past several weeks  and  market liquidity is provided by many active trading and marketing companies that have effective risk management practices and sound capitalizations   osborne noted 
 we at duke energy are committed to our customers and fulfilling our contracts and services without disruption  we also continue to see strong growth opportunities ahead and are extremely confident in our ability to achieve or exceed our financial targets this year and next   osborne said 
the company remains fully committed to deliver earnings growth within its stated guidance of  percent to  percent compound annual growth in earnings per share from a base of     in   based on the strong results reported for the first three quarters of this year  duke energy had previously communicated it will likely exceed  percent earnings growth in   yesterday  s developments do not change that view 
duke energy  a diversified multinational energy company  creates value for customers and shareholders through an integrated network of energy assets and expertise  duke energy manages a dynamic portfolio of natural gas and electric supply  delivery and trading businesses   generating revenues of more than   billion in   duke energy  headquartered in charlotte  n  c   is a fortune  company traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol duk  more information about the company is available on the internet at  www  duke  energy  com
