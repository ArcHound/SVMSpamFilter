did enron use partnerships to artificially boost earnings  lawyers are rubbing their hands 
if the truth sets you free  the top echelon at enron corp   present and past  should be feeling positively footloose these days  just in time to get shackled by a slew of shareholder suits 
private securities lawyers and the securities  exchange commission are looking into the houston energy trading firm  s complex relationships with outside partnerships it used to hedge against fluctuations in the value of its investments  where enron sees  st  century financial engineering  lawyers see possible earnings inflation   chairman kenneth lay says enron is cooperating with the sec inquiry  
one partnership  run by enron chief financial officer andrew fastow  added   million in revenue in the first quarter of   boosting enron  s   million in net income in that period  the partnership  s contribution plunged to   million in the second quarter ended june   but investors only found out aug     when enron filed its quarterly   q with the sec  oddly enough  that was the day chief executive jeffrey skilling unexpectedly resigned 
expect class  action lawyers to go after the profits skilling and other insiders made by selling   million in stock when shares were flying high   they  re down   from august    since skilling left  enron has taken a     billion hit to shareholders  equity to unwind partnerships 
 they certainly misled the market as to the size of  partnership losses    says thomas shapiro  one of several lawyers filing shareholder suits against enron  who knows what will emerge from some of the other partnerships

enron shares rise as analysts cite bargain  hunting  financing speculation

new york   after losing nearly two  thirds of their value over the past two weeks  enron corp  shares regained some lost ground wednesday 
bargain  hunting and speculation were said to be behind the buying  with some suggesting that enron is nearing a deal for additional financing  while others are said to be mulling the possibility the company may be acquired 
in afternoon trading on new york stock exchange  enron shares  ene  were up      or    to     on volume of    million shares  earlier  the stock traded as high as     
enron  which typically trades an average of  million shares a day  was again one of the most actively traded stocks on the big board  on tuesday  enron shares set a   week low of      which was the stock  s lowest level in a decade 
commerzbank securities analyst andre meade attributed the jump in enron  s stock to investors attracted by its low price  those buyers  he said  are hoping not to be hit by the  double swords  hanging over the houston energy trader   a securities and exchange commission investigation of the financial dealings of its former chief financial officer andrew fastow  with an off  balance sheet financing vehicle and the possibility of another credit  rating downgrade by moody  s  which could trigger the need to issue additional stock and thereby dilute the holdings of existing investors 
in addition  there is speculation  through the houston circuit  that enron may be close to securing additional financing  said prudential securities analyst carol coale  if the speculation proves true  the financing would help enron to shore up its financial condition and improve confidence among investors as well as its business partners 
investors also may be placing their bets on the belief that enron shares have eroded enough in value to make the company a takeover candidate 
a report in the wall street journal wednesday said several companies including general electric co   s  ge  ge capital unit  warren buffett  s berkshire hathaway inc   brka  brkb  and royal dutch  shell group  rd  have been named as potential buyers for enron 
ms  coale said the takeover speculation was  unwarranted  and has surfaced each time enron shares faltered 
 it would be very unusual    for a company to be interested in a takeover  of enron  given the uncertainty of the sec inquiry  why add that uncertainty to your portfolio   she said 
furthermore  ms  coale said  it might be difficult for a company such as shell to clear regulatory hurdles because it already operates a substantial energy trading business 
commerzbank  s mr  meade also discounted the takeover speculation  he likened such a deal to the acquisition of a financial  service company 
 you are buying a human  capital  based business  you have to make sure you  re not going to loose all your people   he said   it  s a trickier acquisition  
but not everyone thinks the takeover speculation is implausible  roger hamilton  an analyst at john hancock value funds  said shell and enron are  neighbors   and shell has looked at enron  on and off  
still  he said that if there is a buyer for enron  the company would want to do it sooner rather than later in order not to risk damaging enron  s leading market position 
some marketwatchers said at least some of the pressure on enron shares in recent trading sessions has come from mutual funds liquidating their positions to avoid having the company  s name appear among their holdings in their annual reports 
despite the rise in enron shares wednesday  there remains a significant amount of uncertainty about the stock 
in addition to the pending sec inquiry and the lingering credit concerns  attention also is being paid to their effect on enron  s trading business  while several trading counterparties have said that they are watching the situation closely  at least one  entergy corp   etr   is said to be trimming its exposure to enron 
the new york mercantile exchange also plans to use enron  s weakness to recapture part of the over  the  counter energy derivative market by offering its own clearing services and trading tools for the natural gas market

enron trades higher after heavy losses
by lisa sanders  cbs  marketwatch  com
last update     pm et oct    
houston  cbs  mw    shares of enron  which had lost about  percent of their value over the past  sessions  spiked in wednesday trading after a report that pegged the beleaguered company as a takeover target 
enron  ene  news  chart  profile  added  percent  or      to     in recent dealings  volume was heavy at  million shares 
john olson  an analyst at sanders morris harris in houston  pointed out that the heavy losses enron sustained over the last  sessions partly reflects the end of the tax year for mutual funds  the calendar year for funds ends at the close of business wednesday 
 mutual funds who own enron stock have been trying to offset other gains by selling off enron   he said   mutual funds have to register all their gains or losses and offset them by selling or buying stock by the close today  
a wall street journal report wednesday speculated on enron  s potential as an acquisition for a more stable company  enron has been under pressure for more than two weeks  beginning when the energy merchant reported a   billion charge in its third  quarter earnings  a securities and exchange commission probe into two of the company  s limited partnerships and a rating downgrade by moody  s investors service haven  t helped 
olson said he thought an enron takeover unlikely at this point 
 however  if the stock were to keep coming down  and their financial difficulties were extended  the odds would increase   he said 
art smith  chairman and chief executive of the research firm john s  herold  said he  d be surprised if enron was not entertaining offers   it  s one of the ways that enron gets the genie back in the bottle  
on the other hand  smith said  it would take a potential acquirer time to become comfortable with the valuation of the business 
 it  s doubtful that a potential acquirer can resolve all the valuation issues quickly   smith said  he said it  s likely that any sort of purchase agreement would contain what he called a  look  back provision   which would protect the acquirer from being strapped to a fixed value 
smith said he could see either general electric  s  ge  news  chart  profile  ge capital or royal dutch shell  rd  news  chart  profile  making a bid  both were mentioned in the journal report 
 ge capital is big enough that if it didn  t work out it won  t cripple ge  and they  ve been opportunistic on things like this   smith said   and shell always keeps us guessing  
olson also included aig  aig  news  chart  profile  and citigroup  c  news  chart  profile  as potential acquirers 
 enron has certainly had some appeal to people that are used to an aggressive trading culture   he said 
smith said that even without enron  the energy marketing and trading business would continue to thrive 
 even if enron went away  it would not change what has developed into a healthy market for commodity forward markets and hedging   he said

usa  u  s  tech stocks up  blue chips shed gains

new york  oct   reuters   technology stocks held gains in early afternoon trading on wednesday after the u  s  economy shrank less than wall street feared in the third quarter  but blue chips dipped as an early rally faded on worries the worst is yet to come 
 you will need a lot of fortitude to see the mountaintop when we are in the depths of the valley   said jay mueller  economist and portfolio manager at strong capital management inc   which oversees   billion 
the economy suffered its worst contraction since the first quarter of   the government said in its  advance  or early estimate of gross domestic product  gdp  the broadest measure of u  s  economic health  shrank    percent in the third quarter  the number still managed to beat economists  projected  percent drop and helped spark an early rally 
wall street still faces a heavy economic calendar this week and is girding for readings on the manufacturing sector and job market  some economists expect the u  s  economy will give an even worse performance in the fourth quarter as the sept   attacks haunt the nation 
the technology  laced nasdaq composite index advanced    points  or    percent  to       after snagging a gain of more than  percent earlier in the day  sun microsystems inc  jumped  cents to      or  percent  after the network computer maker said orders were tracking higher this quarter than they were this time last quarter 
the dow jones industrial average was off    points  or    percent  at       after climbing more than  percent  eastman kodak co   down     to      or    percent  pressured the blue  chip gauge after moody  s cut its debt rating and warned it may lower the long  term rating again amid falling profits 
the broader standard  poor  s  index rose    points  or    percent  at       the stock market had sold off in the last two days after rallying last week 
wall street widely expects the economy to slip into a recession  but investors are hoping more tax cuts and lower interest rates will lift the economy by   president george w  bush urged congress to pass a stimulus package by the end of november in a speech at the white house 
most economists expect the economic contraction to last at least to the end of the year and if it does  the third quarter would mark the start of the first u  s  recession in  years  a recession is loosely defined as at least two straight quarters of falling gdp 
in other economic news  the national association of purchasing management  chicago said its october index slipped to    from    in september  but this beat economists  estimates of a drop to    
the october index that showed less weakness than expected suggests regional manufacturing could bottom fairly soon  but does not necessarily mean thursday  s national survey by napm will follow suit  analysts said 
 what it  s showing is that the economy  although it  s slowing now  is slowing at a gradual pace as opposed to rapidly plunging off a cliff   said john herrmann  chief economist at ideaglobal   we think the napm index falls a little bit more than this because napm will capture corporations in new york and outside the region of chicago  
the october national association of purchasing management  napm  index  due shortly after the open on thursday  is forecast on average slipping to    from    in september 
intel corp   a dow member and nasdaq heavyweight  added  cents to      or    percent  the world  s largest chip maker sounded a bullish note for long  term growth  saying the billions it  s spending this year will yield profits and market share gains once the high  tech recession abates and growth resumes 
motorola inc  rose  cents to      or more than  percent  after the wireless giant said its global market share rose in the july  september quarter from the second quarter  boosted by sales of new products 
adobe systems inc  fell     to      or nearly  percent  the publishing software vendor said it would cut  jobs  or  percent of its work force  and lowered its revenue and earnings guidance  citing weakening business after the sept   attacks 
enron corp  rose     to      bouncing back from  consecutive days of losses  the wall street journal said on wednesday in its influential  heard on the street  column that with enron trading at book value  some wall streeters see the beleaguered energy trader as a takeover target  enron shares on tuesday dropped  percent to hit  levels amid fears of a credit crunch and concerns over management reluctance to discuss its finances

 c  reuters limited  
london  oct   reuters   u  s  energy major enron corp is close to exiting a joint shipping venture linked to its troubled dabhol power plant in india  shipping sources said 
 enron has pulled out of the lakshmi  the ship  and has dumped it on its partners in the deal  mitsui osk lines and the shipping corporation of india   said one shipping executive 
 essentially it  s linked to the collapse of the dabhol deal   he added 
enron has a  percent stake  valued at   billion  in the dabhol power plant  which has been stalled by a long  running payment dispute with its only customer  a local utility 
 we have been in discussions about greenfield shipping  the ship owning company   but at the moment it is not appropriate to comment on future plans   said a spokesman for enron in houston 
the shipping source said the ship had been contracted at the above  market price of   million from mhi yard in japan  and would need the high charter rate of     per day to cover its costs  this would be difficult to acheive 
enron said the ship had been financed through  percent debt and  percent equity  in which it had a  percent stake
