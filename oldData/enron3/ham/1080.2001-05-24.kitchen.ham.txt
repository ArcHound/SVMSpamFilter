following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units  this mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at year end  vp prc 
we were considering moving to a  peer group structure however it as agreed at the last prc committee meeting to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  or   it was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to  peer groups  all functions  activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached 
the actions points from this excercise are 
 to review and agree the attached mapping
 consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous prc meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them as indicated on the attachment 
 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation 
please return your comments to david oxley by friday may  
to have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final vp  md prc meetings  definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
