this message will focus on travel and entertainment  next week  s message will focus on professional services 
travel and entertainment  enron has a tremendous opportunity to save on travel and entertainment expenditures by making some relatively painless adjustments 
 air travel  air transportation is the single largest component in the travel mix  in recognition of this fact  a number of significant discounts have been negotiated with all of the major carriers  there are two separate channels available to employees to access the enron  negotiated fares  the first is travel agency in the park   tap    or the gss  approved preferred travel agency for your location  and the second is the new enron  managed online travel booking service  clicktrip  located at 
over the coming weeks  gss will be promoting training and usage of clicktrip  as the primary method of booking domestic u  s  travel for a number of reasons  first  excluding proprietary carriers like southwest airlines  clicktrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for their destination  including the enron  negotiated fares  second  industry data shows that employees will generally make the most cost  effective travel decision when presented with the relevant facts  conservatively speaking  we estimate that a   savings in airfare is attainable through the use of this tool alone  third  it is relatively painless to use  fourth  clicktrip is accessible  x  from any internet  enabled personal computer and after  hours telephone support is available  if you have travel  related questions  please contact tracy ramsey at ext     
one final air travel reminder worth promoting  for employees who fly in the united states  use of non  refundable coach tickets generally runs  percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a   fee 
 lodging and car rental  gss has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business unit  s individual hotel policy  additionally  preferred car rental rates including insurance coverage with national  u  s  and canada  and alamo  u  s   have been negotiated for your use  more detailed information is available regarding both programs through our travel site located at
