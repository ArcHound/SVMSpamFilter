subject  enw assets to transfer back to ea
importance  high
elaine 
attached is a listing of the assets on enw  s books that they want to transfer back to ea  the current book value as of      is around   million dollars that would move into pp  e 
if you look at the numbers off to the right and the notes below  you will see that some of them were originally designated as shared assets or solely enw and therefore would reside on enw  s books 
in completing their  plan and meeting with their commercial people  enw thinks these assets should be back on ea  s books 
please let me know if you agree to this 
thanks 
stacey
