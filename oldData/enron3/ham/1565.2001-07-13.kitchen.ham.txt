hello 
congratulations on your new arrival  hope you are all well  got married on  may and got sunshine in dublin on the day 
we are running the virtual entry capacity as an auction
bids due in on  july  may be extended if transco delay their auction 
 year minimum term
any terminal
we have right to refuse gas at the beach on payment of compensation chosen by customer in the bid 
we are still running analysis to produce beach curves based but current thinking is that
current market inefficiency is inflating the price  we are currently buying day ahead interruptible fergus capacity at    p and buying gas as it turns firm on the day at nbp   p 
our aim is to take out the conservative guys in our auction so the transco auctions should be less ridiculous  summer max price was  p but the average was  p  with wide spreads in each auction round
we have modelled with transcost to verify transco  s view that fergus can be expanded by   for  p  th lrmc
also we have some other risk management angles we intend to pursue if we end up with a large position
offer underwriting on incremental investment by transco
code modifications to increase capacity auctioned
build a pipeline 
it would be great to get your views on it  shall i give you a call when we  ve pulled together the curve analysis
