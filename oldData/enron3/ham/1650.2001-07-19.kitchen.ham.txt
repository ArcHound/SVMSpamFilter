Subject hpl other alternatives
here are a few alternatives to handling lal echterhoff  s situation 
   we give cash difference in black  scholes value between one year and three year options calculated as of the termination date of       the analysis isn  t very pretty  the total difference for all affected shares      is only    these options are so far in the money that the time value is de minimus 
   we could have them cancel their old options and purchase on the open market some options with longer terms  the lowest strike price available for january  leaps is   and the term still isn  t quite long enough  most affected options have a strike price between   and    this alternative would need tax  accounting  and sec research and would cost about   mm in total 
   we could just purchase january  leaps with a strike price of   and not ask them to cancel their old options  this would cost aobut     mm  still a problem with term not syncing with their old options  but it would give them the opportunity to  double  dip  in value if the stock ran up between now and may    
              
if you would like me to do any further due diligence on any of the three above  let me know 
i still recommend the previously drafted email to lal reiterating that the plan provisions prevail  morally  it may not be correct  but it would take an exorbitant amount of  feel  good  and money to get any further improvements in our ranking as the best place to work  everyone knows what enron is when they come here and we  re very open about it  we are efficiently darwinistic  not feel  good  anything  you  want  i don  t think we should apologize to those who don  t read their agreements or plan documents or the fine print  the caveats were there  
i do feel bad that this happened  and we should make sure the right people sign  off on this sort of thing in the future
