new york  nov   reuters   stocks slipped on wednesday  eroding the previous session  s sharp gains  as worries about the gloomy economic environment overshadowed hopes the federal reserve  s rate cuts can help spur a rebound 
 you get these fights with the bulls and the bears   said james volk  co  director of institutional trading at d  a  davidson  co   there are a number of people that are bullish about the economy turning around    and there  s another group that think there  s no reason for this buoyancy in the market because it  s still way  way premature  
the market initially built on tuesday  s rally when the fed  s  th interest  rate cut this year sent stocks soaring to their highest levels in about two months  but momentum faded toward the end of wednesday  s session 
 we had a big run up yesterday after the fed announcement   said peter coolidge  senior equity trader at brean murray  co   the announcement was expected  but the run  up wasn  t  so we  re just giving up a little bit of ground on that  
the technology  laced nasdaq composite  buffeted early in the session by disappointing results and a discouraging forecast from wireless telecommunications firm qualcomm inc   finished with a gain of    points  or    percent  at      
the dow jones industrial average slipped    points  or    percent  to       at its session high of       the blue  chip index had erased all of its post  sept   losses 
the broader standard  poor  s  index fell    points  or    percent  to      
shares of hewlett  packard co  dragged on the dow after hp and compaq computer corp  stood firm on their plans for a   billion merger  even as pressure mounted from hewlett and packard family members to cancel the deal 
hewlett shares slipped  cents to      the stock gained more than  percent on tuesday after the founding hewlett family  which has a stake of more than  percent in hewlett  packard  said it would vote against the deal  compaq  s stock sagged  cents to     
energy trader enron corp  was badly beaten yet again  plunging to a   year low of   amid concerns about its ability to raise cash  late in the day it got a boost from a wall street journal report that rival dynegy inc  is in talks to infuse about   billion into the struggling company  enron ended down  cents at     
interest  rate  sensitive financial stocks like j  p  morgan chase  up     at      and american express co   up     at      underpinned the blue  chip dow 
stocks have surged in recent weeks as investors put aside their current economic woes  hopeful that the fed  s rate reductions and a hefty fiscal stimulus package can help the economy spring back by the middle of next year 
investors got encouragement from the latest key economic report  which showed productivity rose more strongly than expected in the third quarter as firms cut workers  hours at the fastest pace in  years  the government data suggested companies are adjusting to the slowdown in economic growth 
 any time productivity is up  that  s good news for the market   said robert baur  chief economist for invista capital management  which oversees   billion in equities 
wireless  related stocks were buffeted after qualcomm  which holds the patent for a popular cellular technology  reported earnings that missed forecasts  it also said profits for the current fiscal year would be at the low end of already reduced estimates  citing the global economic slowdown 
nevertheless  qualcomm still managed to erase its early loss to gain  cents to      the american  traded shares of swedish mobile phone giant ericsson slipped  cents to      while the shares of finnish rival nokia dropped  cents to     
heavyweights like networking giant cisco systems also underpinned the nasdaq market  cisco gained  cents to     
the market will likely remain rangebound in the very near future as investors search for solid evidence that a recovery is at hand  analysts said 
 it  s usually a time when traders tend to take their gains  because there  s nothing left for the short term to look forward to   said a  c  moore  chief investment strategist at dunvegan associates 
one bright spot was america  s no   trash hauler waste management inc   which posted a net profit  due in part to lower costs and interest expenses  even after taking a charge to settle the last of a series of class  action lawsuits  it jumped     to     
shares of lands  end inc  were also hot  racing up almost  percent  or     to      after the internet and catalog retailer posted quarterly results that handily beat wall street forecasts on effective cost controls and solid sales of full  priced merchandise

new york  nov   reuters   enron corp  may have lost its luster in the financial markets but trading partners in north america  s natural gas and power arenas are supremely confident that their largest trading entity will not go under 
 we are not changing anything about our credit arrangements with enron  they are still paying their bills   said one electricity trader 
 credit  wise  they are okay but people are watching  people are probably a little more wary in the forwards market  they may think twice before going into a five  year deal   he added 
as a matter of fact  transactions on the houston  based company  s power trading system enrononline were higher over the past  days  averaging some   billion to   billion  up from     billion in the earlier period  making enrononline by far the biggest trader of electricity 
traders played down reports wednesday of new york mercantile exchange clearing firms raising margin requirements for enron  s trades on natural gas futures markets 
 it would be a normal procedure after the credit downgrades   said a trader with a major midwest gas and power trader 
despite the fears that increased credit margins might cause a crunch for the embattled energy giant  many traders still say it is business as usual 
 they have plenty of credit with us  they are still a viable trading partner   said a natural gas trader with one of enron  s largest natural gas trading partners 
enron  s share price has gone into a tailspin in recent weeks after the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years and as concerns about its complex finances led to a probe by the securities and exchange commission and a series of downgrades by the major credit ratings agencies 
ratings agencies like standard  poor  s said it would consider cutting enron  s rating again if it saw a change in behavior in enron  s trading partners

new york   dow jones   trading companies in enron corp   s  ene  key north american power and gas markets are restricting their dealings with the ailing houston  based giant  people at those companies said wednesday 
concerns have mounted because enron  which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country  s power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on its internet  based system enrononline  has seen its share price fall by about   and its credit ratings downgraded since mid  october due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure 
 we  ve restricted our business with them   said mike smith  chief financial officer for mirant corp   mir  unit mirant americas group  a top  trader of power and gas in the u  s 
smith wouldn  t be more specific  but his comments echoed those of others in the business 
 our exposure to enron is insignificant compared with the previous exposure   said al butkus  spokesman for aquila inc   ila   a top  u  s  power and gas trader 
tractebel energy marketing  the north american subsidiary of the belgian company tractebel s  a   has limited the term of transactions with enron to three years or less  a person at the company said  and a power broker said some medium  sized western utilities have stopped trading with enron even for near  term delivery 
enron didn  t return calls seeking comment 
enron  s ability to transact in its core markets  north american wholesale gas and power  is essential if the company maintain the earnings and cash flow needed to emerge from its current credit crisis  wall street analysts and ratings agencies have said  standard  poor  s and moody  s investors service downgraded enron  s credit
to within two steps of junk  bond status last week and have it on watch for
further downgrade  enron still has its supporters  exelon corp   exc  is
monitoring its own risk management  but hasn  t changed its relationship with
enron  chief financial officer ruth ann m  gillis said 
 we haven  t changed our relationship   gillis said 
enron is a very important factor in the vitality of the wholesale energy markets  she said  they  re still the  largest  best  of the companies out there  she said 
likewise  a trading floor manager at one energy company said enron called earlier in the week and asked that the company increase its trading on enrononline  the company  s eol volumes had fallen  but it honored enron  s request out of respect for enron  s still market  making power 
ppl corp   ppl   however  moved to mitigate its exposure to enron following the downgrades  said a person in the company  s energy marketing operation  ppl energyplus llc 
 enron would not be a first choice to do long  term transactions   the person said   for shorter  terms  deals  they wouldn  t be considered equally with everyone else  there  s just too much risk there

new york  nov   reuters   energy company dynegy inc   is considering investing   billion in rival enron corp  in a transaction that may lead to a merger of the companies  the wall street journal reported on its online edition on wednesday

 updates share price  report enron has approached warren buffett in paragraph   enron discussed merger with dynegy in paragraph   el paso comments in paragraphs    
new york  nov   reuters   shares of enron corp  plunged in a new round of selling on wednesday  touching a   year low  as concerns linger about the energy trading giant  s ability to raise cash and restore investor confidence 
the company  s stock slid more than  percent in intraday trade on the new york stock exchange  before paring losses to trade down      or    percent  to     in the afternoon  the stock briefly touched    a price last seen in may  
enron was the most active stock in nyse trading  and the second  largest loser in percentage terms  the stock is down almost  percent since the company released its earnings results on oct    which set off the recent tumble 
representatives of enron have approached warren buffett  the chairman of berkshire hathaway inc   about taking a stake in the energy trader  the new york times reported tuesday 
 we have been exploring all of our options to strengthen our balance sheet and increase investors  confidence   said enron spokesman mark palmer  who declined to go into further detail or discuss specific companies 
cnbc reported enron and dynegy inc  have held talks about a range of options  including a merger  the network cited sources close to the talks 
enron and dynegy said they do not comment on speculation  a spokeswoman for berkshire hathaway said buffett was traveling and could not be reached 
the issues that have plagued the houston  based company over the past three weeks continue to weigh on it  according to jeff dietert  an analyst at simmons and co 
 it  s a bit of a vicious cycle   he said   the stock price declines  credit concerns go up  counterparties attempt to reduce their exposure and the earnings power of the company deteriorates  
he added the nation  s largest trader of natural gas and electricity needs to  get all its ducks in a row  so it can meet with its stock and bond holders to discuss enron  s capitalization and plans for strengthening its balance sheet 
already  at least one of enron  s rivals is benefiting from the company  s woes 
el paso corp   which also runs an energy marketing and trading business  said on wednesday it has gained market share in the past few weeks as a result of reluctance on the part of companies to do business with enron 
but ralph eads  who heads el paso  s merchant energy business  said he does not expect enron to file for bankruptcy and said el paso has not scaled back its business dealings with the company 
he also said he does not expect enron  s problems to lead to reduced liquidity in u  s  electricity and natural gas markets  a scenario that has troubled some analysts and investors 
enron is under attack over investor unease about its off  balance sheet transactions that led to a     billion write  down of shareholder equity 
the deals  conducted with partnerships run by ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow  are under investigation by the u  s  securities and exchange commission

staff reporter of the wall street journal
dynegy inc  is in advanced discussions to infuse about   billion into enron corp  in a transaction that may lead to a full  blown merger between the two companies  people familiar with the matter said 
a formal transaction could be unveiled as early as thursday  these people said  the situation is very fluid and is subject to change  these people noted 
enron  ene  has been rocked by last month  s disclosure of a     billion reduction in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnerships headed by enron  s former chief financial officer  last month  it reported a third  quarter loss of   million  the securities and exchange commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter  last week  enron secured   billion in new credit lines  using gas  pipeline assets as collateral 
enron needs the infusion in part because its previously announced plans to raise cash through the sale of power assets is going more slowly than expected  mostly  though  it needs to restore its credibility with wall street at a time when its access to the financing markets is drying up 
enron declined to comment and dynegy couldn  t be reached for comment 
news of the dynegy discussions was first reported on cnbc

houston energy trading firms  haven  t agreed on a price  the
people said  dynegy is proposing a stock swap with a modest
premium while enron is holding out for more  the people said 
  if history is any guide  dynegy is stingy when it comes to
acquisitions  so i don  t expect them to do anything stupid   such
as overpaying for enron  said ubs warburg llc analyst james
yanello    a deal could provide dynegy with tremendous
opportunity   
dynegy would gain an established wholesale energy business

customers  and the largest internet energy trading operation  many
times larger than dynegy  s  he said  yanello rates dynegy   strong

  we would be very surprised if dynegy buys the whole
company    said tim ghriskey  president of ghriskey capital
partners  which doesn  t own enron or dynegy shares 
  all the  dynegy  board has to do is look at what  s
happening to their stock price today  and you  d wonder why they
would want to do it in the face of what  s happening with the
stock   
the talks were previously reported by the wall street journal
and financial news network cnbc 
enron also set to meet with j  p  morgan chase  co

go with worldcom  wcom  nasdaq  news  commentary  instead  these guys actually get it  they are among the telecom industry  s best operators  and they are the best dealmakers  like everyone else  they goofed  but they have found religion  this quarter  s operating results show some promise  previously skeptical analysts at lehman and merrill had some nice things to say about the company  i think worldcom is an up stock from here  it is not going back to the   s  but i could see it above the driving age by year  end

forget this  too  providian feels like a doughnut to me  their balance sheet is a mess  we do not know how bad it is  they may not know how bad it is  moreover  they were not candid with the investment community 
conseco announced that gary wendt and other senior managers bought a bunch of stock with their own money  while i love to see management buying stock  this one feels too staged to me  pre  wendt  conseco had a long history of management buying stock with loans from the corporate treasury  moreover   million shares  or   million  is not that much money to wendt  i would like to see him buy   million of restricted stock directly from the company 
conseco is probably the best speculative bet of the bunch  but i would still pass  it is a very high  risk situation  given the leveraged state of its balance sheet  wendt is a tremendous manager  and he did a great job with ge capital  however  he would not be the first guy to have a sequel that bombs at the box office 
go with citigroup  c  nyse  news  commentary  instead  citigroup is the biggest and best financial services company in the world  while wendt is something special  i would draft weill and rubin ahead of him in my ceo rotisserie league

fundie firing comes better late than never
by james j  cramer

hallelujah  someone in mutual  fund land lost his job for crummy performance  two years ago merrill lynch decided to hire a real mutual fund gunner  james mccall  and install him in the merrill lynch focus twenty and premier growth funds 
mccall was from pbhg  there  the guy was a total gunner in the true basketball sense  all offense  no d  he came to merrill and played the same game  buying all of the stocks i have been railing against in these last  months  this guy owned them all 
he proceeded to totally stink up the joint 
i don  t mourn mccall  he represented the worst strain of money manager  the kind who  d never met a high growth stock he didn  t like  a man who didn  t give a hoot about valuation  his bets on bea systems  juniper  emc  sonus  celestica  oni systems and extreme should have been enough to give him the hook  but he also bit on enron 
mccall  s funds were dead last in merrill  s fund standing  so he left  that  s what should happen  i just wish it had happened sooner 
this industry made a mess of itself the last few years by picking managers who were reckless in their stock picks and never thought about the downside 
the industry really let the investors down 
the departure of mccall is a good sign that things are returning to how they should be  where you sacrifice some upside in order to spare your investors the massive downside that mccall experienced 
now  let  s hope the other mutual fund families exercise similar discretion 
better late than never
