new york   dow jones   investors are running for the exits as doubts about enron corp   s  ene  planned merger with dynegy inc   dyn  mount 
debt and equity markets are taking news of enron  s never ending credit woes with renewed pessimism tuesday  sending the company  s stock down almost   and its bonds sharply lower 
and with so much riding on dynegy  s financial support  risk arbitrageurs  those investors who bet on the stock price of companies involved in merger  aren  t willing to play   there is just too much risk   said a trader at a new york risk arbitrage firm   nobody wants to even get close to the deal  
perhaps most telling about the uncertainty surrounding enron and the merger with dynegy is the fact that even a   risk premium over the value of the dynegy deal has so far failed to attract investors   the deal appears in real jeopardy here   a bond trader said 
under the merger plan  enron holders would receive    dynegy share for each enron share  at dynegy  s current share price of      that means the value of the deal is about     a share for enron holders  but enron stock recently traded as low as     a share  almost   below the value of the merger 
adding to doubts about enron  s long  term viability  the company said in a delayed quarterly filing late monday that its ability to continue as a going concern depends on a number of factors  including being able to retain an investment grade credit rating 
dynegy declined to comment on whether its decision to merge with enron would be affected by the company  s latest securities and exchange commission filing  including the disclosure that enron will have to repay   million in debt by next tuesday if it doesn  t come up with collateral for a loan 
an enron spokeswoman wasn  t available to comment on the merger plan 
among other bad news  enron  s latest report warned investors that the company faces immediate demand for     billion in debt if its credit rating is downgraded any further 
earlier this month  standard  poor  s corp  and moody  s investors service cut enron  s credit ratings to  bbb   and  baa    just one notch higher than below  investment grade  or  junk  status  the rating agencies warned that they may cut their respective ratings again  neither s       dow jones newswires

in the   q  which was filed five days past the sec deadline  enron revised its third  quarter earnings downward by  cents a share  and disclosed it may have to pay off a   million note owed to an affiliated partnership because a clause in a financial agreement was triggered by the reduction in enron  s senior unsecured debt rating to triple  b  minus by standard

accounting watchdogs to examine auditors  peer review process

accounting watchdogs to examine auditors  peer review process
washington  nov    bloomberg    the accounting industry  s
watchdog group plans to examine whether audit firms are conducting
adequate   peer reviews   of one another in light of arthur
andersen llp  s failed audits of enron corp   according to the
group  s chairman  charles bowsher 
a detailed review of the enron case rests with the securities
and exchange commission  the public oversight board chairman said 
the board will look at the bigger issue    which is how can you
have peer reviews and still have these kinds of failures   
bowsher said 
the pob  a private group created to oversee the accounting
industry  s self  governance as an advocate for the public  will
take the matter up at a closed meeting in washington on dec    he
said 
houston  based enron  the largest energy trader  earlier this
month reported that it overstated earnings by   million over
four  and  a  half years  inflated shareholder equity by     billion
because of an   accounting error    and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet 
andersen  the world  s fifth  largest accounting firm  served
as enron  s outside auditor for more than a decade  assuring
investors that the company  s financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles  the sec is investigating
some of enron  s partnerships 
firms that audit public companies submit to   peer reviews  
of their accounting practices by other accounting firms  a
practice aimed at assuring the investing public that the firm
complies with professional standards 
u  s  representative john dingell  a michigan democrat  said
yesterday in a letter to bowsher that none of the big five
accounting firms has ever issued a negative report against another
at the end of any peer review 
dingell skeptical
  there appears to be little reason for the public to have
faith in andersen or the peer review process    dingell wrote 
andersen responded saying it had faith in the accounting
profession  s self  regulatory process  which the pob oversees 
a spokeswoman at deloitte  touche llp  andersen  s peer 
reviewer  didn  t return a telephone call seeking comment 
deloitte  the third  largest reviewer  is conducting a peer review
of andersen now 
bowsher  a former u  s  comptroller general  said the pob was
thinking of looking into peer review issues before receiving
dingell  s letter 
  but this letter certainly focuses the issue    he said 
dingell  s letter said the outside counsel to a special
committee of enron  s board has retained deloitte  touche to help
it review the company  s accounting problems 
conflict of interest 
  do dt  s dual roles create a conflict of interest   
dingell  s letter asked    if dt finds numerous problems on enron 
will dt try to  whitewash  or reconcile them in order to be able
to issue a clean peer review report   
dingell also questioned whether the money andersen pays
deloitte  touche for its current peer review will sway the
outcome 
  how will this influence  if at all  dt  s  independent 
judgment of andersen  s work on enron    the letter said 
bowsher responded   there  s nothing we can do to change the
fact that deloitte  touche has done the previous reviews of
andersen  now  the question is should they  the outside counsel 
use the same firm  or would it be better for them to use another
firm  and that  s pretty much their decision   
bowsher said he has no knowledge of the accounting problems
at enron beyond what he  s read in newspapers 
  it looks pretty bad  doesn  t it     he said 
expanded power
dingell  s request could prove a test of the pob  s recently
expanded power and oversight  the group  s charter was revised
earlier this year to make the pob the accounting industry  s
premier watchdog group following criticisms by former sec chairman
arthur levitt and former sec chief accountant lynn turner  they
criticized the   alphabet soup   of accounting self  regulators and
voiced frustration with the industry  s oversight of itself 
the new charter put the pob in charge of supervising the
setting of auditing and audit  independence standards and
monitoring how firms audit public companies  it also gave the
board  which is funded by the industry  the power to set its own
budget with no strings attached 
  now  for the first time  we will see if the pob is able to
act in the public interest and undertake the mandate presented to
it by congressman dingell and by its new charter    turner said 
  they didn  t have the power in the past   
the pob was set up in  to represent the public interest
in overseeing the accounting industry  s self  governance structure 
before its charter was revised  the pob was just one facet of the
enforcement of auditing industry standards regarding publicly

newpower plugs cash drain by revamping power pact with enron
washington  nov    bloomberg    newpower holdings inc  
one of the first companies to market power to homeowners
nationwide  recently plugged a cash drain brought on by plunging
energy prices 
the purchase  new york  company buys gas and electricity from
suppliers such as enron corp  and resells the energy to
residential and small business customers in states such as
pennsylvania  ohio  georgia and texas  newpower markets its
service as an alternative to local utilities in restructured
retail energy markets 
recent declines in energy prices have required newpower to
deposit   million in cash with enron  its largest shareholder
as well as a major creditor  leaving the company with about  
million  according to a regulatory filing  enron recently agreed
to allow newpower to replace some of the cash collateral with
assets such as inventory and customer ious 
  we had a certain amount of cash tied up in those collateral
positions    said william jacobs  chief financial officer at
newpower    obviously  every dollar you put up there reduces the
amount of money you can spend other places   
newpower represents a new breed of energy middleman that
contracts to provide power to retail customers at certain prices 
rather than owning power plants and gas pipelines  though  the
company simply purchases energy   at slightly lower prices   from
suppliers such as enron 
the contracts with enron require newpower to post collateral
with the supplier if the market price of natural gas or
electricity falls below the price set in the contract  and prices
for natural gas  used to fuel most electricity plants  have
plunged 
offsetting contracts
natural gas for december delivery fell    cents to    
per million british thermal units on the new york mercantile
exchange  that is down from a record     per million british
thermal units last december 
newpower isn  t at risk of losing money because the company
has offsetting contracts to sell the electricity and natural gas
at even higher prices to retail customers  it  s more of a timing
issue  the company has had to post the collateral before the sales
under these retail contracts take place 
nevertheless  the need to provide collateral has weighed
heavily on newpower  s balance sheet  cash and cash equivalents
have declined to     million on sept   from     million on
dec      meanwhile  restricted cash  such as the collateral
provided to enron and others  has ballooned to     million from
    million during the same period 
other transactions
on oct    according to a quarterly report filed with the
securities and exchange commission  enron agreed to permit
newpower to substitute inventory and customer receivables for as
much as   million of the cash collateral  this agreement will
expire jan     
  assuming broadly stable forward energy prices    the filing
said  newpower   has sufficient financial resources to conduct its
business until it secures permanent asset  backed or similar
financing   
the company also said in the sec filing that it has recently
entered into a series of transactions   to reduce the risk of
posting additional cash as collateral   if energy prices fall
further  these transactions  which the company says are an
exception to its usual hedging strategy    increase the company  s
exposure to commodity price fluctuations   
joint venture
newpower was formed as a joint venture between enron  general
electric capital corp   the california public employee  s
retirement system  the ontario teachers  pension plan board  and
the merchant banking arm of donaldson  lufkin  jenrette inc   now
owned by credit suisse group 
in october   the company held an initial public offering
of  million common shares at   each  newpower shares have
fallen more than  percent so far this year and now trade at

without repayment or collateral  investors in a partnership
that owns brazilian natural  gas assets can begin to liquidate the
partnership  s assets  enron said  the company said it  s working
with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt 
enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and
take debt off its books  its shares plunged this year as investors
questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide
losses from failed investments 
chief executive officer kenneth lay said earlier this month
that buying back  million shares from two such partnerships cost
enron shareholders     billion in lost equity 
making good on debt owed by its whitewing affiliated
partnership may cut enron  s fourth  quarter earnings  enron said 
enron is obligated to back whitewing by issuing junior convertible
preferred stock  because enron  s stock has plunged  it may have to
write down its assets by   million  the filing said 
dynegy agreed nov   to buy enron in a transaction now valued
at   billion in stock and assumed debt  both companies are based

usa  reliant surprised by latest enron disclosure 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
houston  nov   reuters   reliant resources inc   a trading partner of beleaguered energy trading giant enron corp   said on tuesday it was surprised by news that enron could be forced to pay   million in debt next week because of a credit rating downgrade 
shahid malik  reliant  s president of energy trading and marketing  said his company was still evaluating the implications of the disclosure  which enron made in a filing with the securities and exchange commission  sec  on monday 
 it  s another surprise to the industry  we don  t need any more surprises   malik told reporters at a press presentation of a new index devised by houston  based reliant to track natural gas consumption 
reliant is a big wholesale electricity and natural gas trader and as such both a competitor and trading counterparty of enron 
malik said enron executives had not mentioned the potential payment of   million during a conference call with analysts on nov    two days before the credit rating downgrade that triggered it on nov   
enron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival dynegy inc  for some   billion in stock on nov   after a collapse in investor confidence and snowballing financial problems brought enron to the brink of collapse 
dynegy wrote clauses into its agreement with enron that allow it to walk away from the deal if the problems at enron turn out to be far worse than previously disclosed  but dynegy executives have said it is unlikely those clauses will be invoked 
malik said that as a trading partner in wholesale energy markets  reliant will seek further clarification from enron about its financial position 
 my guess is that they are going to have a hard time coming up with the money   he said 
malik said enron  s bids and offers in the wholesale electricity and natural gas markets had become less competitive in recent weeks and that this had allowed reliant and other companies to capture some market share from enron 
reliant continued to do business with enron  he said  but was exercising  heightened caution  
malik said reliant had not hired any traders away from enron recently and was currently well staffed   but you always look for good people  you always look for talent   he added

new york   dow jones   many energy trading companies were unwilling to sell power and natural gas for next day delivery to enron corp   ene  tuesday morning  a result of heightened credit concerns following the release of enron  s quarterly financial report monday  traders and other sources said 
for weeks  companies have limited both buying and selling with enron for future deliveries  but for the first time since enron  s troubles began a month ago  energy companies weren  t selling to enron in the spot markets for fear that enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month 
 it  s pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away for now   said charlie sanchez  energy market manager for gelber  associates in houston 
traders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldn  t sell to enron tuesday morning  several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed the situation  but declined to say so on the record 
 nobody will take enron   one western electricity broker said  after struggling  however  that broker eventually found a utility that was willing to sell to enron tuesday morning 
calpine  a prominent independent power producer and trader  said it was willing to sell power to enron 
 we continue to sell power to enron and are monitoring the situation closely   spokeswoman catherine potter said 
the situation tuesday morning was fluid  one utility that refused to sell to enron in the morning was willing to do so in the afternoon  a person at the company said  that company  s trading  however  was still limited to the spot markets 
credit concerns about the once  dominant energy trading company were heightened with enron  s filing of its third quarter annual report monday evening with the u  s  securities exchange commission 
enron may have to pay   million on a note that became a demand obligation with the company  s most recent credit  rating downgrade  enron said in monday  s filing  the company also warned that its profits in the fourth quarter could be hurt by credit concerns  a decline in asset values and reduced trading activity 
 the  q in and by itself is a document that could raise concerns   fitch analyst ralph pellecchia said   we have a lot of questions outstanding relative to disclosures that were new to us and their strategies of how they are going to manage the situation  
companies are willing to buy from enron in the spot gas and power markets  because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer
an enron spokesman didn  t respond to a request for comment 
reliant resources  rri  and the bonneville power administration  the federal government  s western power marketer  both said their organizations are continuing to  do business  with enron  but when asked specifically if they were selling spot power or gas to enron  spokesmen for both declined to comment 
 we  re watching the situation very carefully   said reliant spokesman richard wheatley   there is a lot of speculation because of the filing yesterday  
energy companies began shying away from enron over the past month  as concerns about its finances precipitated a   drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk  rated debt 
traders and their companies have said consistently that until enron  s credit ratings improve  they will continue to watch their exposure to enron carefully  with trades limited to short  term deals 
moody  s investors service  standard  poor  s and fitch all rate enron one notch above speculative grade  moody  s has enron  s ratings on review for a downgrade  and s  p has enron on negative credit watch  fitch calls enron  s credit rating  evolving   enron  s ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment  grade ratings 
the manager of one hedge fund that follows enron closely said tuesday that several trading companies expressed strong concerns about enron  s financial viability  but the manager thought those concerns weren  t proportionate to enron  s position 
 they have nine days to work out the   million debt payment  and if they can  t work it out  they have the cash to make the payment   the manager said 
dynegy inc   dyn   which has agreed to buy enron in a stock  swap currently worth about   billion  injected     billion into enron last week  enron has also closed on   billion worth of revolving credit lines with j  p  morgan chase  co   jpm  and citigroup  c  in the past week  with   million of that amount closed monday 
developments with enron  however  have raised enough concerns that energy companies aren  t willing to extend themselves into positions that have even the appearance of vulnerability  sanchez of gelber  associates said 
 the industry has been shell  shocked by their recent announcements  and they  re not ready to go back to trading with them   said sanchez of gelber       mark  golden  dowjones  com

us ferc denies regulatory waiver for dynegy lng terminal

washington   dow jones   the federal energy regulatory commission denied tuesday dynegy inc   s  dyn  request for regulatory exemption of its planned liquefied natural gas  or lng  import terminal on the u  s  gulf coast 
in what would be the first new lng import site in nearly two decades  dynegy has proposed converting an existing terminal in hackberry  la   to receive lng imports at a rate of up to  million cubic feet a day with capacity to later expand up to    billion cubic feet a day 
in its august application to ferc  dynegy said lng import terminals should no longer face regulatory burdens designed in the  s 
tuesday  ferc said  there is no indication that congress intended to remove commission jurisdiction over the siting  construction  and operation of lng import facilities   the commission added that  there would be a regulatory gap without commission jurisdiction  
ferc chairman pat wood said it was a close decision to deny the company  s request  although commissioners voted unanimously to do so 
commissioner william massey said granting a regulatory waiver would have made it impossible to ensure open access to the lng facility  which he described as  a gatekeeper to the u  s  market  
three of the four existing u  s  lng import terminals are under strict ferc price regulations  dynegy said these regulations and the guaranteed cost recovery they entail led to unnecessary lng investment in the early  s  the company argued that lng imports should be treated as  first sale  gas over which the commission has no jurisdiction 
dynegy announced the project in july and planned to begin receiving lng shipments by the end of  
the project involves converting an existing liquefied petroleum gas terminal and dock to receive lng  dynegy plans to convert an lpg tanker under construction to carry lng instead by the targeted fourth  quarter  start of operations  and it would seek additional lng tankers in  
companies use lng tankers and terminals to import gas from remote overseas gas fields in countries such as algeria  trinidad       campion  walsh  dowjones  com

usa  update   enron stock hits decade low after debt warning

 previous dateline new york  updates paragraphs    share price  s  p announcement 
houston  nov   reuters   shares of enron corp  plunged to their lowest level in more than a decade on investor concerns more debt problems loom at the crippled energy trading giant 
in late afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange  shares of enron were off      or    percent  at      after touching an intraday low of      a low not seen since may  
enron was far and away the day  s most  active stock  with more than    million shares changing hands  volume was more than double the second most  active issue  xerox corp 
 everyone wants to sink the ship faster  this is a sell  off from yesterday  s news which was hyped by the media   said fulcrum global partners analyst michael barbis 
enron warned in a u  s  securities and exchange filing released after markets closed on monday that it could be forced by next week to pay   million in debt because of a credit downgrade on nov   
the filing made the stark statement that enron would fail to be a  going concern  if a further credit cut forces it pay off     billion in debts to partnerships it is involved in  an early payoff of those debts would render enron unable to service its revolving credit accounts  starting a downward spiral  it said 
meanwhile  credit rating agency standard  poor  s said that it may again cut enron  s bbb  minus rating  which could trigger those debt payoffs  but the agency said enron  s liquidity issues were unlikely to derail its merger with smaller cross  town rival dynegy inc 
next week  s deadline
analysts said there were no surprising revelations in enron  s filing yesterday and that it should have no effect on plans by rival energy trader dynegy inc  to buy enron 
 the facts have not changed so dramatically for the stock to be down this magnitude   barbis said 
on monday  enron disclosed it is up against a nov   deadline  when it must deliver collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships 
if not  the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership  which include a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise   million in cash 
enron is working to make alternative payment arrangements  since it can ill  afford to pay the debt now  enron has already already maxed out its   billion credit line  secured roughly   billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat 
 enron has access to more than   billion in cash  they can pay off this note  they have cash coming in and are not illiquid   said barbis   the timing of the note could have been better  but enron keeps cash on hand for situations like this  this will not undermine the dynegy deal  
on monday  the houston  based company also reduced previously reported  third  quarter earnings by  cents per share and increased reported earnings for the first  months of the year by a penny per share

cnnfn  market coverage  morning
 c  copyright federal document clearing house  all rights reserved 
rhonda schaffler  cnnfn anchor  market call  chuck kadlec is our guest host tracking the sell off  you know  the enron  url  http     www  enron  com   story you know has been in the headlines now for weeks  but it  s one of these cases where if you invest in a stock and you sort of buy into the story  it  s very difficult for some investors who now lost a lot of money  and everyday it seems there  s a new revelation there  how do you counsel people to sort of  you know  catch things that even some of the street don  t catch 
charles kadlec  j  w seligman  well  it  s obvious you can  t catch them because  if we could have  we would have  the best analysts on the street missed this one  i think the real message here is the importance of diversification  and i think it also raises some important questions about corporate governance at enron  and there  clearly  was something missing not only among the senior executive officers of that corporation but the board of directors as well 
schaffler  in general  we  re seeing the markets just sort of retreat here  but it seems to be one of these sort of calm pullbacks we  ve talked so much throughout the show  the dow started the day up better than  percent 
the nasdaq up about  percent from the lows 
and the one situation we  ve had when the markets pulled back  through those couple of weeks  is the buyers always come back in  we know that fund inflows were up in october  we also know october sometimes is when we see bottoms in markets  just historically it seems that it happens in october  the data on the fund flows  does that intrigue you at all 
kadlec  well  i think it  s just another of those straws in the wind  if you will  the leading economic indicators being up    percent today  i wouldn  t bet the ranch on that single number  but it  s positive  better than expected  positive inflows suggest that fear  which was not only impacting the market  was clearly impacting the economy  starting to recede that  s a positive 
and i think individual investors are beginning to look beyond the immediate news into next year  and  you know  we  ve had nine recessions  up until now  we  ve had nine recoveries  we  re probably in the middle of the  th recession  and we  re going to have a recovery  so  as people begin to try to size up the shape and the duration of that recovery  they  re beginning to  again  deploy their assets back into equities  which provide the best long  term returns of any asset class 
schaffler  it  s interesting too because  you know  we  ve talked through the last couple of months it was always the cash on the sidelines  you know  we kept quoting how much was in money market funds just waiting to be deployed  do you have any sense of how much momentum there is still to come into this market  how much money there might still be out there  do you get the idea that the institutions as well as some retail customers might still be holding on to some money to re  deploy assets at this point 
kadlec  my sense is that  like at seligman  for example  our teams are really focused on positioning the portfolios and to take advantage of the upturn that  s coming  so you  re seeing a move more toward cyclicals  selecting really good companies that perhaps are oversold 
we  re also seeing horizons lengthen out a little bit  people beginning to think of what all of next year is going to look like  really  very little attention to what  s happening in the fourth quarter of this year  we already know the economy  s in trouble  if anything  we  re set up for a positive surprise i think over the holiday season in terms of the consumer here 
schaffler  let  s find out exactly what  s going on now at the big board 
we know that stocks are moving lower

deregulation not seen leaderless after enron  s collapse
by bryan lee
of dow jones newswires
    
dow jones energy service
 copyright  c    dow jones  company  inc  
washington   dow jones   the movement to deregulate the country  s electricity markets is about to find out whether it needs the   pound gorilla that has long sat in its corner 
for years  enron corp   ene  has been the country  s most aggressive advocate of opening energy markets to competition  and enron is now on the ropes  slated if all goes as planned to be absorbed by smaller rival dynegy inc   dyn  
but industry observers said its demise won  t open a leadership void in the regulatory battle  while enron  s efforts were critical in the early efforts to pry open markets  that work has largely been done  and there are now plenty of like  minded companies able step in  observers said 
 it is true that enron has been a leader in pushing policies for a competitive market   said linda stuntz  a former top energy department official now with stuntz  davis  staffier   but the news is they  re not alone any more  there are a lot of others who will carry the flag  
enron  an object lesson in how the mighty have fallen  has been the industry  s undisputed leader in pushing for competitive power markets at both the federal and state levels  the company is a dominant player in any policy debate before the federal energy regulatory commission  and its positions weigh heavily as congress debates electric industry reform legislation 
lobbyists describe enron  s washington office as  huge   far surpassing that of dynegy 
enron also had tremendous political clout  the company successfully backed top texas regulator pat wood iii for the ferc chairmanship earlier this year  enron chairman ken lay has been a key political backer of president george w  bush  raising at least     for his campaign  the company itself contributed     
enron spent     million in the last federal election cycle  making it one of the nation  s biggest political contributors  according to the center for responsive politics  an advocacy group that monitors political campaign spending and influence 
 the company  s contribution total for the  elections more than doubled its political donations in each of the two previous election cycles   the center reports 
broad support seen for markets
no company has come close to making enron  s commitment to shaping the laws and regulations that govern the energy industry  still  industry observers see support for competitive energy markets even without enron  s largess 
 i think that there is a tremendous political will from all the leaders on all sides of congress and the administration to move forward on electricity competition legislation   said edison electric institute president thomas kuhn   i don  t the think the enron situation is going to make any difference at all 
officials with the two companies adamantly reject the premise that their merger will create a vacuum in the push for greater competition in the   billion electricity sector 
 dynegy  s going to continue to advocate open and competitive markets   spokesman steve stengel said   i can  t speculate on what the new company is going to spend on lobbying efforts or what the combined entities  staff will look like  but clearly enron and dynegy share a belief in open and competitive markets  and the new entity will certainly continue to be vocal about opening markets to competition  
rick shapiro  enron  s managing director of global government affairs  echoed that view  he also said it was unlikely opponents of deregulation would succeed in using enron  s troubles as a reason not to further open markets 
 there will be companies that will try to use enron  s business problems as a reason to not move forward  but regulators will separate what happened to enron from the rightness of the idea   shapiro said   the validity of competition has been proven over and over again  this is not going to have a long  term effect  
dynegy will probably inherit some of enron  s aggressiveness in lobbying  stuntz said 
state  level view mixed
energy lawyers suggested that  in many respects  the public policy debate over competition has already been won  for instance  one  third of the power  generation capacity in the u  s  is now owned by companies other than the utilities that once enjoyed monopolies  stuntz said 
 i  m not sure at the end of the day this really changes all that much   said william scherman  a former ferc general counsel now with skadden  arps  slate  meagher       bryan  lee  dowjones  com

houston  nov    bloomberg    enron corp  shares and bonds
dropped after the energy trader disclosed it may have to pay    
billion in debt due by   suggesting the company may run out of
cash before its takeover by dynegy inc  can be completed 
shares of enron fell      or  percent  to      earlier
they touched      the lowest price in more than a decade 
enron  s    percent notes due in july  were bid as low as 
cents on   of face value and offered at  cents  down more than
 percent  traders said 
enron  whose dealings with affiliated partnerships led to
earnings restatements  credit  rating cuts  a federal investigation
and a management shakeup  said in a regulatory filing that it has
less than   billion in cash or credit lines  dynegy plans to
complete its buyout by october  and enron may have to ask lenders
to restructure payment schedules to survive 
  this filing shows that enron is in a precarious financial
situation    said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade  who
rates enron shares   hold   and doesn  t own them    they have to
stay afloat for the dynegy deal to go through  and that now looks
difficult   
enron and dynegy spokespeople wouldn  t comment on the stock
drop today  standard  poor  s investors service said that enron  s
credit rating remained on negative watch  indicating it wouldn  t
immediately downgrade the company  s debt 
  million surprise
  enron  s near  term liquidity position is    expected to be
sufficient to carry the company through the completion of its
proposed merger with dynegy    s  p said in a report 
investors were concerned the debt  including a   million
note that enron disclosed it may have to pay off next week  would
lead to a cut in enron  s credit rating  analysts said 
the filing was a   distraction   that will not threaten the
merger  said todd shipman  a director at s  p who follows enron 
  our approach to this has been on the basis that the dynegy
deal is a good thing for credit quality    shipman said 
moody  s investors service  which didn  t issue a statement on
enron  s debt today  kept the company  s credit rating at investment
grade on nov    the day dynegy announced it would buy enron in a
deal now valued at   billion in stock and assumed debt 
the ruling came after executives from lehman brothers

smith barney lobbied the credit  rating company  people familiar
with the situation said 
avoiding junk
a junk rating would have led dynegy to abandon the
acquisition  dynegy chief executive officer charles watson said 
it would also have triggered debt repayment of at least    
billion  enron said in a securities  exchange commission filing
yesterday 
enron shares are selling for almost  percent less than the
value of dynegy  s offer  showing investors have doubts the deal
will be completed  dynegy shares fell     to     today 
  it  s become more clear that the chances of this deal going
through aren  t  percent  but much closer to fifty  fifty    said
edward paik  who helps manage the liberty utilities fund  with   
million enron shares    there  s just so much information that is
unknowable   about enron  s financial position  he said 
most of the     billion in debt is due before the end of
the third quarter of   when the dynegy buyout is scheduled to
close  enron said yesterday in a filing with the sec 
asset sales planned
last week  enron chief operating officer greg whalley said
the company will sell assets of   non  core businesses   to raise
money  it has   billion invested in the businesses  including
broadband telecommunications and the dabhol power plant in india 
enron expects to get   billions   from the sales  whalley said 
without being more specific 
enron reported yesterday that its u  s  operations had    
billion in cash left  it has added at least   billion since sept 
 from credit lines  loans and a     billion investment from
chevrontexaco  part owner of dynegy 
enron used     billion of the money it raised to retire
commercial paper  which is short  term debt  it gave no details on
how it spent the remaining     billion 
enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said last week
that the company also was looking to get another   million to
  billion from private investors 
asset sales valued at about   million are expected to
close by the end of this year  according to the sec filing  enron
spokeswoman karen denne wouldn  t comment on whether it could sell
assets fast enough to keep current on its debts 
dynegy will have to help enron sell assets  said mitchell
stapley  who manages     billion in fixed  income assets including
enron bonds for fifth third investment advisors inc 
dynegy and chevrontexaco corp   which owns  percent of
dynegy  also will have to help enron negotiate with its lenders

american utilities fund  which is  percent dynegy shares 
debt questioned
  i never dreamt  the     billion  would be that large 
coming due all at once    vuchetich said    it calls into question
their decision to schedule it that way in the first place   
chevrontexaco  the second  largest u  s  oil company  is
providing     billion in cash as part of the enron buyout  it
provided the first     billion a week ago  in exchange for that
investment  dynegy will get a pipeline valued at more than  
billion if the enron purchase is not completed

share  bringing the period  s loss to  cents  or   million  on
nov    enron lowered earnings back to  by   million to
reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept
off the books  that included a third  quarter reduction of  
million 
a drop in enron  s senior unsecured debt rating to   bbb    by
standard  poor  s on nov   may force enron to pay off a  
million note by nov   if it doesn  t find collateral to guarantee
the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership that owns brazilian
natural  gas assets  the filing said 
without repayment or collateral  investors can begin to
liquidate the partnership  s assets  enron said  the company said
it  s working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement
on the debt
