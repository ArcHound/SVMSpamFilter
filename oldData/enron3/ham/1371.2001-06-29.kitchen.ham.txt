here is a highlight of my accomplishments for the first six months of  
 participated in identifying and resolving issues related to the sell of hpl assets to aep 
 developed a mechanism for enron to fill bammel storage prior to the sell to aep and be hedged against the sell to aep 
 negotiated and signed a three year storage agreement with centana allowing for very favorable late summer  winter withdrawals with reduced commodity charges
and very flexible receipt and delivery points 
 predicted weekly aga activity with extreme accuracy compared to the rest of the market 
 generated   million in trading profits  despite not having the bammel storage facility to make me look good like in previous years  like for example in 
the  april  october versus the decemeber  february spread went from a positive    on      to a negative    on      which generated a loss of       and this was only one of seven years  since      that spread has gone from a negative    to a positive    which would have generated income of       but i did not get any of that impact since the facility was sold  but wait a minute that didn  t make me look good did it        
thanks  jim
