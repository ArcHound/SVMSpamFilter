subject  status of cpuc proposed decisions on direct access suspension
jeff 
at your request i am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda
items before the cpuc on the issue of suspension of the direct access
program  there are two pending draft decisions at this time  the first is
the proposed decision of alj barnett  item h   on the last agenda  which was
modified by a changed version submitted by pres  lynch at    pm on      
the day before the last meeting  this version indicated that direct access
was suspended as of the date of the order  which would have been sept   
and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise
their customers that the suspension is effective sept      specifically
naming that date  this order would have been interpreted to suspend direct
access as of sept   if it had been voted out that day  the other item 
agenda item h   a on the last agenda  is the bilas alternate decision which
calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance
of bonds  and does not suspend direct access at this time 
please be advised that the suspension date contained in h   can and probably
will be changed before the orders are considered at the cpuc meeting on
sept    either the sept  date will be changed to the  th of sept   or
some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order
dealing with the suspension date  all that is required to make this change
is the distribution of a changed page on the escutia table before the
commission meeting  thus  it is important for all direct access supporters
to continue to urge the commission  especially commissioner brown  to
support a suspension date later than sept    because it is so easy for the
date to be altered under commission procedures 
please let me know if you require any additional information on this
