dear john 
my colleagues and i are working with australian power and energy limited  apel  that is developing a   billion synfuel and power plant project in the latrobe valley of australia in victoria using brown coal 
the power plant project will be    mw  part of the synfuel production will be clean  burning diesel fuel of about    barrels a day  worth about       a year at today  s prices  
apel was wondering whether enron could have an interest in marketing the power and  or the diesel fuel  apel also would be open to suggestions should enron wish to be involved in other ways 
the principals apel are in houston this week and could meet with enron this thursday afternoon   july 
john  would or your colleagues like to meet with apel this thursday  and if so  what time and where would be convenient 
thanks and best regards
