enron corp  said it has been contacted by the securities and exchange commission seeking information on the energy giant  s controversial dealings with partnerships that were set up and run until recently by its chief financial officer  andrew s  fastow 
following enron  s announcement yesterday morning of the sec inquiry  the company  s stock took another big slide  falling more than   in new york stock exchange trading  as of  p  m   enron shares were trading at      off      knocking about   billion off enron  s market capitalization  volume topped the big board  s most  active list at about  million shares  a week ago  enron stock was trading at about   a share  subsequently  the company announced a     billion third  quarter write  off that produced a   million loss 
analysts also voiced concerns yesterday about possible other bad news lurking amid enron  s vast and extremely complex operations  the company has dealings with a number of related entities  under certain circumstances  if enron  s credit rating and stock price fall far enough  the company would be obligated to issue tens of millions of additional shares to these entities  diluting the holdings of current shareholders 
enron has previously acknowledged the provisions but said its business is strong and it feels confident that there will be no defaults 
in a statement  enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said the company  will cooperate fully  with the sec inquiry and  look  s  forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest   enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the fastow  related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed  the company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership  related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions 
the sec inquiry came from the agency  s fort worth  texas  regional office  according to a person familiar with the matter  this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the sec  s enforcement arm  as opposed to its corporate  finance section  the participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law  however  enforcement  branch inquiries often don  t produce any allegations of wrongdoing  it also appears that the sec hasn  t yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation  which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated  the sec declined to comment 
certainly  there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions  which contributed to a     billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of enron  s efforts to unwind the deals  mr  fastow  who has declined repeated interview requests  resigned from the partnerships  known as ljm cayman lp and ljm  co  investment lp  in late july in the face of rising conflict  of  interest concerns by wall street analysts and major company investors 
since then  internal partnership documents have shown that mr  fastow and perhaps a handful of enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the ljm   the larger of the two partnerships 
mr  fastow  s partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside enron  according to people familiar with the matter  for instance  these people say  sometime after the creation of the partnerships in   enron treasurer jeffrey mcmahon went to company president jeffrey skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by mr  fastow  s activities  mr  skilling didn  t share mr  mcmahon  s concern  these people say  and mr  mcmahon requested and received reassignment to another post 
mr  skilling resigned as enron president and chief executive in mid  august  citing personal reasons and the fall in enron  s stock price  which peaked at about   a share last year  mr  mcmahon and mr  skilling haven  t responded to repeated interview requests 
investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in enron  s dealings with other related entities  in some cases  enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so  called double trigger provisions occur 
for example  last july enron helped create the marlin water trust ii  which sold   million in notes that are due july     however  enron can be considered in default  in advance of that date  if its stock price falls below     for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either moody  s investors service or standard  poor  s 
currently  enron debt is still investment  grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category  last week  moody  s put enron on review for a possible downgrade  however  observers believe that even if moody  s lowers enron  s rating  the company will still be investment  grade

enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors  but its decision to reduce equity by     billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market 
the action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner  more important  investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect enron  s balance sheet  profits and earnings guidance 
enron didn  t provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction 
enron doesn  t include a balance sheet in its earnings release  so the equity decrease couldn  t be spotted in numbers supplied tuesday  and even though enron did break out   billion in earnings charges in its release  the company didn  t feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text 
instead  the public first heard about it on a tuesday conference call  ceo kenneth lay said enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so  called  structured finance arrangement   the wall street journal later reported that enron  s counter  party in this transaction was an investment partnership called ljm  co  investment  which has set up and run by enron  s finance chief  andrew fastow 
this is what lay said on the tuesday call about the equity move   in connection with the early termination  shareholders  equity will be reduced approximately     billion  with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding   according to the journal  lay then said wednesday on another call that enron had repurchased  million shares 
enron  s supporters count lay  s mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish  because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future 
but there are two possible problems with this theory 
first  enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make     per share in operating earnings next year  critically  the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the  million shares or not  if the forecast does assume the exclusion of the  million shares  the company should have upped its  per  share earnings forecast by around    since that  s the amount by which the share count will be reduced  enron needs to say what share count it  s using in its guidance 
second  it  s almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded  casting a certain amount of doubt on lay  s assertion that the share count will come down 
why question the ceo  well  in its  annual report  enron included some disclosure of the  million shares connected with ljm   it reads   at december     enron had derivative instruments    on    million shares of enron common stock   the derivative instruments appear to be types of options  or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices 
but these derivatives  linked shares don  t show up where they should in the annual report  in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts  the line item in this table that shows options  related shares totals only  million shares  which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion  therefore  that number almost certainly doesn  t include the  million ljm   related shares  the fact is  at least some of the  million derivatives  linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options  that  s because the ljm  derivatives appear to have been  in the money   or profitable for the holders  typically  all in  the  money options  based stock has to be included in the diluted share count  and these ljm  derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of   back then  enron stock was trading around    way above the average   level at which these derivatives made money for ljm  
maybe these weren  t simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count  that  s what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply  alternatively  the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure  though it  s hard think where 
presumably  investors will get a full explanation in enron  s quarterly financial results filing with the securities and exchange commission  due by the middle of november
