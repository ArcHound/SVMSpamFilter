enron corp  said its chairman  kenneth lay  has decided to forgo a severance payment of     million that could be triggered by dynegy inc   s planned acquisition of enron  mr  lay  s decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice 
early in the day  an enron filing with the securities and exchange commission laid out mr  lay  s severance package  by midday  enron indicated that mr  lay would keep only one  third of the payout  which he would take in stock in the combined company  and that he intended to donate one  third to a foundation to help displaced enron employees  the remaining third would cover income  tax liabilities 
but by the end of the day  enron spokesman mark palmer said that mr  lay  following a meeting of enron energy traders  had decided against taking any of the severance pay  though mr  lay didn  t attend the traders  meeting  senior managers told him that  opinions were expressed that he shouldn  t receive the payment   mr  palmer said   he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment   the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enron  s profits  questions for mr  lay were directed to mr  palmer  who said he had spoken with mr  lay and other company officials during the day 
the initial disclosure about mr  lay  s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago  last friday  mr  lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase  which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent  though he declined to elaborate   things weren  t desperate    we had alternatives   mr  lay said  the   year  old mr  lay won  t have an executive position at the combined company  though he might be a director 
for the  months ended aug    mr  lay received about   million through the exercise of enron options  according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial  last year  mr  lay was paid     million in salary and bonus and more than   million in stock awards and other compensation 
enron  the nation  s largest energy trader  saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company  s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers  those dealings are under investigation by the sec  last friday  enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houston  based dynegy for stock  currently valued at about     billion  the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies 
separately  the california public employees  retirement system  which owns about three million enron and    dynegy shares  said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company  michael flaherman  chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enron  s board  failed in its responsibility  to monitor the activities of enron executives 
mr  palmer  the enron spokesman  said mr  lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from  forward  in february   when enron stock was trading between   and   a share and mr  lay was being widely lauded for his performance  he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously  last august  when chief executive jeffrey skilling quit unexpectedly  mr  lay assumed mr  skilling  s duties and his contract term was extended by two years to dec     
under the terms of his contract  mr  lay is entitled to payment of     million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract  in the event that his employment terminates within  days of a change in control  thus  mr  lay is entitled to three full years of payments  or     million 
mr  lay  who took charge of the then  houston natural gas co  in  when it was a regional pipeline company  wasn  t the only member of his family to benefit from enron  s heady rise to a global energy giant  sec filings show that in recent years a sister of mr  lay  sharon lay  and a son  mark lay  received millions of dollars in salary  commissions and bonuses related to ms  lay  s travel agency and a paper  products company connected to the younger mr  lay 
mr  palmer said it is a  cheap shot  to criticize the lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements   the contracts were bid out and fairly awarded   mr  palmer said  ms  lay said her travel agency  of which she is president and half  owner  had won its enron business through competitive bidding and by providing  the very best service possible   mark lay couldn  t be reached for comment 
coming on top of disclosures of enron  s dealings with partnerships run by its own executives  the relationships between lay family members and the company again raise questions about enron  s willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests  former chief financial officer andrew fastow and possibly other enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships 
mark lay  s dealings with enron date back to   according to the available sec filings  in may   mark lay and  certain other individuals  who together had been officers  directors or shareholders of a company called paper  print management corp   or ppmc  entered into employment agreements with an enron unit  enron capital  trade resources  according to enron  s  proxy statement  the individuals helped set up  a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products   according to the sec filing  mr  palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of enron  s profitable paper and pulp  trading business 
as part of the deal  enron agreed to reimburse ppmc   million for certain expenses  mark lay and his colleagues also agreed to  convey  to enron  certain intangible property rights  from ppmc 
mark lay also got a three  year employment contract from enron as a vice president of enron capital  trade  he got a signing bonus of      a minimum monthly salary of      a minimum annual bonus of     for    and an option to purchase    enron shares  mark lay is no longer with enron and is now attending a seminary  said mr  palmer 
since   sharon lay  s firm  lay  wittenberg travel agency in the park inc   has provided travel arrangements for employees of enron and its predecessor company  for this work the agency received     million from  through   in an interview yesterday  ms  lay said enron accounted for more than half of her firm  s revenue in some years  she said her brother  s position was  more a problem  than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn  t worked hard enough to get enron  s business

kenneth l  lay  enron corp   s embattled chairman and chief executive  in recent weeks has cashed in nearly   million of shares in companies at which he sits on the board 
mr  lay   years  sold     million of shares  or more than a quarter of his holdings  of compaq computer corp   where he has been a director for  years  in his first sale of the houston  based company  s shares since   he disposed of    shares oct   for     each  leaving him with a    share stake  apart from two directors who resigned  he is the only compaq insider to have sold shares this year 
the sale comes as the computer company awaits completion of its planned merger with hewlett  packard co    a deal the board has repeatedly said it supports  in a nov   news release  the board  including mr  lay  said it  reaffirmed its strong support for the proposed merger   a day earlier  h  p  s founding hewlett family  which controls   of h  p stock  said it intended to oppose the merger  throwing the deal  s future into uncertainty  compaq shares traded at      up      as of  p  m  in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday 
the sale  mr  lay said  wasn  t related to his views on the merger   it  s no negative  reflection  on compaq   he said  mr  lay  who also sold shares of drug maker eli lilly and it has disclosed a regulatory probe into its complex transactions with off  balance  sheet partnerships  shares have recovered some ground since friday  s announcement by dynegy inc   a rival houston independent power producer  of plans to acquire enron  shares of enron traded at      up  cents  or    on the big board as of  p  m 
as previously reported  mr  lay sold     million of his enron shares this year  as the stock fell from about   to under    and his remaining stake is valued at about   million  for   he earned a salary of     million  a bonus of   million  plus     million in enron restricted stock and other benefits  including use of a personal plane  according to enron  s proxy statement 
mr  lay  who was enron  s ceo from  until february of this year  resumed the post after his successor  jeffrey skilling  stepped down in august after only six months on the job  at that time  mr  lay agreed to stay on through   but his employment agreement provides for a lump  sum payment under a change of control  such as the proposed merger with dynegy  according to a regulatory document filed yesterday  the deal is expected to close sometime next year  in which case mr  lay would be entitled to     million under his contract if he terminates his employment within  days of the merger  in addition  mr  lay is entitled to an amount for any related tax penalties if the payment was deemed to constitute an  excess parachute payment   the filing said 
mr  lay also serves on the board of eott energy corp    the general partner of eott energy partners lp   and newpower holdings co 
mr  lay also recently sold his stake in i  technologies inc   according to his spokesman  following mr  lay  s resignation from the board of that company oct   after serving for a year  as of march   he owned    shares of the dallas business  software company  a stake that would have been valued at about     at the time he resigned

enron chief will give up severance

trying to quell a furious reaction from employees outraged that he stood to profit from a merger with dynegy inc   kenneth l  lay  the chairman and chief executive of the enron corporation  decided late yesterday to give up a severance package worth more than   million 
the tumult at enron  s headquarters in houston began after the company disclosed in a securities filing earlier in the day that mr  lay was in line to collect     million in pay after the deal closed next year      million for every full calendar year left in his employment contract 
mr  lay had been a popular leader as enron grew in the last  years from a pipeline operator into the nation  s largest energy trader  a business largely of his invention  employees shared in the gains  though none gained as much as mr  lay  who has collected more than   million since   mostly through exercising stock options 
but the value of employees  stock options and their   k  accounts evaporated this fall as enron shares plummeted amid concerns over the company  s accounting practices  and traders and other workers started the day yesterday gossiping angrily about mr  lay  s severance package 
then  at an afternoon meeting of employees in the company  s core natural gas and electricity trading operation  which provides by far the biggest part of enron  s profits    quite a bit of concern was raised about the news people had been seeing about this change  of  control payment    mark palmer  an enron spokesman  said 
at about  p  m  central time  two senior executives who had attended the meeting  john lavorato and louise kitchen  told mr  lay about the reaction of employees    ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether    mr  palmer said  even if dynegy  s directors later voted to award mr  lay a new severance agreement  he would turn it down  mr  palmer added 
  what ken said is that this is the absolute cleanest way to remove any doubts  that he was not going to profit as a result of this change of control    mr  palmer said    this issue was causing enough concern among employees that he wanted to deal with it   
severance pay had been an awkward matter for mr  lay in the last week  the only reason that enron was being acquired   putting the severance clauses in his employment contract into effect   were the financial problems that have occurred on his watch  the company  s shares have lost almost  percent of their value after peaking in the summer of  
during merger discussions last week  mr  lay told dynegy  s chairman  charles l  watson  that he wanted to rework the severance package  mr  palmer said  on monday  mr  watson disclosed that mr  lay wanted much of the severance to be in the form of stock options 
by yesterday afternoon  enron officials were saying that mr  lay planned to take two  thirds of the severance in stock or other noncash compensation  and  they said  he wanted to give half of that amount  or one  third of his total package  to establish a charitable foundation to benefit enron employees 
it was about an hour later that enron said mr  lay would give up the severance entirely 
mr  lay has not decided whether to accept an invitation to be on the board of the combined company  which will be called dynegy 
the deal could still fall victim to antitrust objections or disclosures of further financial problems at enron 
whether mr  lay  s gesture will placate enron  s traders  who are now deluging other energy  trading companies with resumes  remains to be seen  dynegy is known as a much more conservative firm than enron  and analysts renewed their concerns yesterday about the cultural clash draining the talent  and value  from the combined company 
  so much of their top talent is going out the door  i don  t know what dynegy gets    said a senior executive at another rival firm 
the stunning near  collapse of enron   bankruptcy was only averted  some analysts say  by the dynegy acquisition   closes a chapter on one of the most influential careers in the history of the energy business 
the ugly circumstances of enron  s downfall  including the revelation that partnerships were used to move debt off the company  s balance sheet and that enron overstated profits in the last five years by almost   million  have left mr  lay  s reputation in tatters 
just months ago  mr  lay was widely hailed   or decried  in some circles   as the genius behind energy deregulation  his friend  george w  bush  had been elected president  and policies favored by enron were front and center in the administration  s energy policy  mr  lay retired from day  to  day management  making plans to pursue new business interests 
but he again assumed the chief executive  s post at enron in august  after the unexpected resignation of his handpicked successor  jeffrey k  skilling  and the accounting problems swiftly unfolded in the weeks that followed  on monday  mr  lay said he might revive the business plans he set aside during the summer  but he declined to say what those plans were 
even without the severance package  mr  lay has become enormously wealthy running enron 
all told  from  through this year  mr  lay collected about   million in salary  his exact salary for this year is not known  and     million in cash bonuses  but those sums were dwarfed by the     million in profits that he received in selling stock 
the bulk of his income from exercising options came in the last four years      million in       million in       million in  and     million this year   a year in which he sold stock by prearrangement on every trading day through july   and then stopped  not wanting to appear to be selling as the stock price was declining 
the options he has cashed in recent years  as well as those he now owns  are badly out of the money at enron  s current stock price of      down from a peak reached in  of     
his bonus in  was   million  an award that enron  s board said was based on the company  s rising profits and high shareholder return  the company restated those profits last week  explaining that it had improperly applied accounting rules  it said that about  percent of its profit in  came from transactions with partnerships that were controlled by andrew s  fastow  who was then enron  s chief financial officer 
the company  s stock price  which was in free fall after questions about the fastow partnerships prompted an investigation by the securities and exchange commission  fell to   a share in the wake of the disclosures  that was the lowest price for the stock since   it rebounded to nearly   after dynegy agreed to acquire the company in a stock swap 
in january  enron  s board awarded another bonus to mr  lay  of     million  that was based entirely on the company  s shareholder return from  through   which came to  percent  the company said  all of that return has since been wiped out 
also in january  mr  lay was awarded    shares of restricted stock  to vest periodically through   all the shares will now vest when the dynegy deal is completed  and while their value has plunged  the award is still worth more than   million 
still  mr  lay suffered huge paper losses this year 
at the end of   he had    million options that could have been exercised for profits of     million  and another    million options that would have been worth another     million when enough time had passed that they could be exercised   assuming the share price stayed level  he exercised    of those options this year  making a profit of     million  but the ones he did not exercise are now under water

companies  finance the americas  regulators face new boundaries in enron deal

regulators wading into the competitive landscape following dynegy  s offer to buy enron will be scrutinising a new industry where traditional yardsticks like market definition and barriers to entry have yet to be determined  this will make gaining approval of the   bn deal an uncertain and complicated task  experts said 
dynegy and enron have insisted the merger  which will combine the largest energy trading company in the world with one of its largest competitors  will be approved by federal regulators without significant conditions or divestitures 
but competition lawyers said this week that because the market for energy trading is so new  indeed  it was all but created by enron in the  s  that federal agencies will have to spend months finding out how rivals compete in order to develop guidelines to measure the merger  s impact 
 we don  t have any track record here   said ernest gellhorn  an antitrust expert at george mason university 
the deal will be reviewed by state and federal agencies  but the most critical approvals will come from the federal energy regulatory commission  ferc  and us antitrust agencies 
central to the antitrust review will be how competition authorities define the market  how big it is  which companies are included as competitors  and how the market share is divided up 
former antitrust officials said enron might be forced to resort to a  failing firm  defence  which is occasionally used by companies with large market shares when attempting to add to their dominant position 
but robert mctamaney  an antitrust partner at carter ledyard  milburn  said the failing  firm route may be difficult for dynegy and enron to prove  since it requires a showing that without the merger  enron  s trading business would exit the market completely 
helping the companies  however  is the relative ease with which competitors can enter the trading market  experts said 
an analysis of barriers will hinge on whether rivals can successfully argue that the level of expertise in the industry is so sophisticated  or that enron  s trading technologies are so specialised  that it would be impossible for new entrants to duplicate the company  s operations 
dynegy executives said they expect more scrutiny from ferc  though it rarely rejects mergers  and its guidelines put an emphasis on speed of reviews

ken lay  the chairman and chief executive of enron  is set to turn down a dollars    m pay  off to which he was entitled following the troubled power group  s takeover by dynegy 
mr lay  who oversaw enron  s rapid rise and its subsequent collapse and sale to dynegy  was due the payment under an employment contract he extended when he resumed full control of the company in august  
however mr lay decided yesterday after meeting with some enron employees that he would turn down the payment 
 ken lay will not accept the dollars  m when he leaves   an enron spokeswoman said   he felt like it was not the right thing to do  
according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission  mr lay is entitled to dollars    m in cash for every remaining year in his employment contract if he leaves enron within  days of the company being taken over 
mr lay  s decision is in sharp contrast to other senior us executives who have negotiated  and accepted   golden parachutes  which guarantee them large payments even if they oversaw large  scale destruction in shareholder value 
mr lay had previously come under fire from shareholders for selling some of his enron shareholding before the collapse in the company  s stock price  between january and july this year  he sold enron shares with an estimated value of more than dollars    m 
at the close of trading yesterday enron was valued at dollars    bn  compared with a peak of dollars    bn in august last year 
the terms were part of mr lay  s original employment contract  which had been due to expire in december   but in august  following the sudden departure of chief executive jeff skilling  enron  s board extended mr lay  s contract by two years 
at the time  the contract extension was seen as an attempt by mr lay to restore investor confidence in the company  but it also ensured he would receive an additional dollars    m if he left following a sale 
after the dollars    bn dynegy takeover  mr lay is expected to give up his executive responsibilities  he may join the combined group  s board of directors but this will not affect his eligibility for a pay  off  the deal  which requires the approval of us competition authorities  is expected to be completed next year

enron chief relinquishes severance pay

enron corp  chief executive kenneth l  lay on tuesday waived a severance payment of at least   million due him when dynegy inc  completes its expected acquisition of enron next year  company officials said 
the potential payment  disclosed in a securities and exchange commission regulatory filing tuesday  would undoubtedly have sparked additional controversy  given lay  s primary role in the sharp fall of enron  s stock and worsening financial condition  which led to the dynegy deal 
the payment would have been one of the biggest rewards for failure in corporate history  said graef crystal  a leading compensation expert 
the payment would have topped the nearly   million mattel inc  paid former chief executive jill barad after she was ousted in  after spending     billion to purchase a money  losing software business the company eventually gave away to a technology group in return for a slice of future profit 
it would have been almost double the   million in severance collected by former xerox corp  chief executive richard thoman when he was fired in may  after a disastrous reorganization of the copier company  s sales force 
according to enron spokeswoman karen denne  lay spoke to a number of employees tuesday and  decided that the best course of action would be for him to waive his right to payment  
 instead   denne said   the combined company would decide the best use of those funds  
lay and enron have run into a storm of criticism in recent weeks after the disclosure of a series of partnerships and the dismissal of several top executives who invested in those ventures 
news of the partnerships and their losses forced the houston  based company to restate its earnings last week  reducing corporate profits over the last four years by   million  or about    to     billion 
shareholders have filed a series of lawsuits against enron  charging the company with failing to disclose key information about its operations and financial structure 
the negative disclosures sparked a cash crunch and threatened enron with collapse until it was saved by an agreement friday to be acquired by houston  based dynegy for   billion 
shareholders have watched the value of enron shares decline almost   from a high of nearly   on aug      its shares closed tuesday at      up  cents  on the new york stock exchange 
ceo already reaped
  million in options
according to the regulatory filing  lay stood to collect     million a year  plus certain extraordinary tax expenses  for each of the full years remaining on his contract once the company was acquired 
if the dynegy deal is completed as expected next year  lay  s payment would have totaled at least     million  his contract ends on dec     
lay already reaped about   million in stock option gains the last two years alone  those gains were in part made possible by rosy enron profit statements  which the company restated downward last week  crystal said 
 it is a good move to waive the payment   crystal said   but that  s just the down payment on what he should give back  there is probably another   million in option profits he should give back  had they correctly stated the books  the stock would not have risen as high and he would not have made as much from exercising his stock options in the company  
a stock option gives the holder the right to purchase a share of a company at a predetermined price  options are a common executive pay incentive  allowing the individual to purchase and sell the shares  pocketing the gains in their appreciation  lay made   million off such transactions last year and   million this year  crystal said 
lay since  has had a  change of control  clause that awards him a special payment if enron changes hands  the company described the clause as a standard part of executive employment agreements common to many companies 
some wall street analysts said the liability for the payment would be dynegy  s problem at the point the merger is completed  enron shareholders already have suffered all the damage they are going to see 
 enron has clearly lost the vast majority of its shareholders over the last six months with its piecemeal disclosure  destruction of shareholder value and loss of credibility   said andre meade of commerzbank securities in new york 
john sousa  a spokesman for dynegy  said the company was aware of the severance clause and had factored the expense into its acquisition  which  we believe is a very strong financial transaction  regardless of the potential payment to lay

kenneth lay  chairman and chief executive of enron corp   decided yesterday to forgo an expected     million severance payment because of the impact of enron  s plunging stock price on the company  s employees  a spokesman said 
until yesterday  lay was preparing to accept the severance payout  which would be triggered at the completion of enron  s purchase by rival houston energy company dynegy inc   a deal announced on friday  enron faced a cash crisis after disclosing it has overstated its earnings by   million over the past four years because of improper accounting treatment of its investments in outside partnerships that were managed by its chief financial officer 
the severance package was reported yesterday by bloomberg news  which included a blistering comment by andrew whalley  manager of a trust that sold   million in enron stock in april because of concerns with enron  s financial reports  bloomberg said 
whalley called the settlement  a ridiculous amount of money  to pay the chairman of a company that suffered  a textbook financial collapse  where he obviously had some knowledge of what was going on  
enron spokesman karen denne said around midafternoon yesterday that lay intended to donate one  third of the severance to enron employees  keep one  third and use the remainder to pay taxes on the entire package  lay  who built enron into the world  s largest energy trading company  was entitled to a payment of     million multiplied by each year remaining on his employment contract if it was terminated before it expires at the end of   the purchase by dynegy is expected to close in   assuming regulatory approvals are forthcoming  giving lay three years of payments  lay said last week that he will retire once the deal is done 
denne checked again with lay later in the afternoon and was told that he had decided not to accept any of the severance payment after a meeting yesterday with enron employees   he realized this was extremely sensitive given the financial condition of enron employees   denne said 
many enron employees hold the company  s stock in savings and retirement plans  and the stock price has fallen from a high of   a share in august  to a low of     last thursday 
enron  s price has picked up since the purchase announcement  closing at     yesterday  dynegy has agreed to pay   billion for enron  about   billion of that in stock  about   a share  when the deal was announced   while assuming enron debt for the rest 
lay  s compensation was increased nearly threefold  to     million  last year  when the company  s annual revenue reached   billion and its stock hit an all  time high

enron  s lay sells shareholdings in other companies  wsj reports
         new york 
houston  nov    bloomberg    enron corp  chairman and
chief executive officer kenneth lay has been selling shares of
companies of which he is a board member  the wall street journal
said 
lay sold about     million  or more than  percent of his
interest  in compaq computer corp   where he has been a director
for  years  the paper reported 
he also sold  percent of his stake  or about    shares 
in drugmaker eli lilly mikhail gorbachev  former president of the soviet union  and colin powell  u  s  secretary of state 
however  greenspan declined the cash and crystal sculpture that accompany the prize 
it  s logical that greenspan talked about energy  considering the award is named for an energy trading company  the institute is researching energy supply and security issues  and the home of the institute is the world  s energy capital 
 as we  as economic policymakers  understandably focus on the impact of the tragedy of sept   and the further weakening of the economy that followed those events  it is essential that we do not lose sight of the policies needed to ensure long  term economic growth   greenspan said 
 one of the most important objectives of those policies should be an assured availability of energy  that imperative has  if anything  been elevated by the heightened tensions in the middle east   an area that harbors two  thirds of the world  s proven oil reserves  
greenspan reviewed the nation  s experiences with seesawing energy prices and episodes of imbalances in supply and demand  he also discussed technologies to augment energy supplies  including coal mining  nuclear power and fusion power 
 energy issues present policymakers and citizens with difficult decisions and trade  offs to make outside the market process  as always  national security and environmental concerns need to be addressed in setting policy   greenspan said 
at the end of the speech  greenspan answered pre  selected written queries from the audience of students  faculty and invited guests  one questioner asked if the state of economy caused greenspan to second  guess his monetary policies 
greenspan rephrased the question as to whether or not he had made a mistake  after much rhetoric  he in effect said no 
 the notion that people have that monetary policy changes one little notch and the economy goes up  clearly has never been the case and is not the case today   greenspan said 
the evening ended with james baker  former u  s  secretary of state and of the treasury  and ken lay  head of enron  presenting greenspan with the award 
rice university officials said it  s premature to know whether the name of the enron prize will be changed if the sale of enron to dynegy is completed 
lay indicated the award would live on when he said   i  m looking forward to our first woman recipient

houston  nov   reuters   enron corp chairman ken lay has turned down the chance to cash in on his company  s financial troubles by refusing to accept a   million payment due him if a proposed buyout by power  trading rival dynegy inc goes through  a company spokeswoman said on tuesday 
he decided it was not right to take the money under the circumstances now confronting the company  enron spokeswoman anne denne said 
enron  the nation  s top trader of gas and electricity  agreed on friday to be bought by the much  smaller dynegy in a stock swap worth about   billion after a controversy over questionable business deals had sapped its finances to the point of near  collapse 
 after having discussions with employees today he decided that this is the right thing to do and he  s going to leave it up to the combined company to determine the best use of that money   denne told reuters 
lay  s contract  which runs through   calls for him to get     million for each full year left in his contract if enron is taken over by another company  enron and dynegy officials have said they expect to complete their merger by the third quarter of next year 
denne said the clause  which is known in corporate circles as a  golden parachute   has been in his contract since  and is a  standard provision  for chief executives 
denne said lay told enron employees of his decision in a company  wide e  mail 
enron has been under the gun from wall street since mid  october when it said shareholder equity had been cut     billion because of off  the  balance sheet deals with partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow 
the u  s  securities and exchange commission launched an investigation into the transactions  which sent enron  s stock and credit ratings into a tailspin and drained its cash as trading partners refused to extend credit 
on friday  enron and dynegy said they had agreed to merge at what seemed a firesale price for enron  which last year had   billion in revenues and   billion in earnings 
also  on tuesday night  lay presented the enron prize for distinguished public service to federal reserve chairman alan greenspan in an event at rice university in houston  previous winners have included the likes of nelson mandela and mikhail gorbachev 
prior to accepting the award  greenspan told students that the most important thing for anyone in the business world was to be ethical 
 i don  t deny that there is an extraordinary amount of activity in the business community which is less than exemplary    but the best chance you have of making a big success in this world is to decide from square one that you  re going to do it ethically   he said

enron chairman lay decides to forgo     million severance payment
    
dow jones business news
 copyright  c    dow jones  company  inc  
enron corp  said its chairman  kenneth lay  has decided to forgo a severance payment of     million that could be triggered by dynegy inc   s planned acquisition of enron  wednesday  s wall street journal reported 
mr  lay  s decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice 
early in the day  an enron filing with the securities and exchange commission laid out mr  lay  s severance package  by midday  enron indicated that mr  lay would keep only one  third of the payout  which he would take in stock in the combined company  and that he intended to donate one  third to a foundation to help displaced enron employees  the remaining third would cover income  tax liabilities 
but by the end of the day  enron spokesman mark palmer said that mr  lay  following a meeting of enron energy traders  had decided against taking any of the severance pay  though mr  lay didn  t attend the traders  meeting  senior managers told him that  opinions were expressed that he shouldn  t receive the payment   mr  palmer said   he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment   the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enron  s profits  questions for mr  lay were directed to mr  palmer  who said he had spoken with mr  lay and other company officials during the day 
the initial disclosure about mr  lay  s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago  last friday  mr  lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase  which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent  though he declined to elaborate   things weren  t desperate    we had alternatives   mr  lay said  the   year  old mr  lay won  t have an executive position at the combined company  though he might be a director 
for the  months ended aug    mr  lay received about   million through the exercise of enron options  according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial  last year  mr  lay was paid     million in salary and bonus and more than   million in stock awards and other compensation 
enron  ene   the nation  s largest energy trader  saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company  s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers  those dealings are under investigation by the sec  friday  enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houston  based dynegy  dyn  for stock  currently valued at about     billion  the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies 
separately  the california public employees  retirement system  which owns about three million enron and    dynegy shares  said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company  michael flaherman  chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enron  s board  failed in its responsibility  to monitor the activities of enron executives

enron chairman says he won  t take dlrs  million compensation package if dynegy deal closes

houston  ap   enron corp  chairman ken lay turned down up to dlrs    million that he stood to receive once the nation  s top buyer and seller of natural gas is merged into its smaller  but stronger rival dynegy inc 
 he has told the employees that he has given a lot of thought to this over the last few days and in light of the circumstances surrounding the company and after listening to the employees he has decided the best thing to do is waive his right to the payment   enron spokesman vance meyer said 
lay decided it best to forego the enron compensation package after consulting with employees tuesday  he let those who work for him know of his decision via voicemail 
meyer said the compensation package was the only merger  related payment lay was eligible for from enron  a dynegy spokesman  john sousa  said the company was unsure if lay could receive a retirement package from them 
enron had a conference call scheduled for  gmt 
dynegy  s purchase of enron  worth at least dlrs    billion in stock  would trigger a clause in lay  s contract that gives him a lump sum of dlrs    million for each full calendar year remaining in his contract if there is a change in control of enron  according to documents filed tuesday with the securities and exchange commission 
lay  s contract with houston  based enron runs through  
dynegy executives have said they hope to complete their acquisition of enron by next summer  the houston  based energy marketer will assume dlrs  billion of enron debt  the enron name will vanish when the deal is completed 
investors continued to bid up both companies  shares tuesday  in the second day of trading following announcement of the deal  dynegy shares rose dlrs     or  percent  to close at dlrs    on the new york stock exchange  where enron shares rose  cents  or  percent  to close at dlrs    
enron shares have gained  percent since thursday  the day before the merger was announced  but the shares are still a fraction of their   week high of dlrs    
dynegy entered talks to buy enron last month as the trading giant  s stock price plunged about  percent in the weeks following enron  s posting of a dlrs  million third quarter loss  the company also disclosed a dlrs    billion reduction in shareholder equity related to partnerships run by company officers  which allowed enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books 
those partnerships are now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission 
enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow  who ran some of the partnerships  and restated its earnings back to   but those actions failed to restore investor confidence 
chuck watson  dynegy chairman and chief executive  will retain those roles for the combined company while lay steps down when the deal is done 
enron spokeswoman karen denne said tuesday the compensation provision given a merger or other change of control has been in lay  s contract since   such protections are common for chief executive officers  she said 
in february  jeff skilling replaced lay as president and ceo of enron and lay retained his title as chairman  lay stepped back into the other roles when skilling unexpectedly resigned in august  citing personal reasons

enron  s ceo to turn down     million severance pay
by laura goldberg
copyright  houston chronicle
ken lay  enron corp   s chairman and chief executive  won  t take the     million in severance he would be due after dynegy closes its deal to buy his troubled company 
lay made his decision tuesday after employees  sentiments about the money were relayed to him  enron spokesman mark palmer said 
at a floor meeting tuesday for energy traders and marketers and back  office employees to discuss the merger  lay  s severance  was a very active topic apparently   palmer said  adding that  quite a bit of concern  was expressed 
documents on a variety of enron matters  including lay  s severance  were filed with federal securities regulators tuesday morning 
under his employment contract  if lay ends his employment within  days of a so  called  change of control   he gets a lump  sum payment equal to the number of full calendar years left in his employment contract times     million 
the merger was announced friday  but isn  t expected to close for six to nine months  lay  s contract runs through dec     
palmer said a change  of  control clause had been in lay  s contract since  
lay won  t have a management role with the combined company to be called dynegy  he  s been offered a seat on the new board  but hasn  t decided whether to take it 
lay  s contract was set to expire on dec      but was extended in august after ceo jeff skilling unexpectedly resigned and lay jumped back into his former job as chief executive 
declining the money  palmer said  was the best way for lay to assure employees that he wouldn  t profit from the severance provision 
last year  lay made     million from various forms of compensation  including a   million bonus  according to enron  s march proxy statement 
he was also awarded options to buy    shares of enron stock at specified prices over a number of years  the options  though  are worthless at current enron stock prices 
this year through aug    lay made     million by exercising options and selling those shares  graef crystal  a compensation expert who writes a column for bloomberg news  said 
lay made an average of     million a year from  to  in various forms of compensation  including exercising options and selling the shares  crystal said 
dynegy on friday announced a deal to buy its rival for almost   billion in stock plus the assumption of almost   billion in debt and   billion in preferred stock 
the price came at bargain  basement rates for a company whose shares as recently as late january closed at    tuesday  shares in enron closed at     
among enron  s woes  a securities and exchange commission investigation  questions on wall street about its financial reporting practices and shareholder lawsuits 
investors reacted negatively to word that lay could get     million 
 this is ridiculous after what has happened   said donald coxe  who manages the harris insight equity fund  which at the end of last month owned about    shares of enron   the idea that there would be a golden parachute for somebody who as a parachute captain sent his stockholders out of the plane without a parachute strikes me as pretty odd  
even before tuesday  lay had other ideas for the severance 
early last week  palmer said lay proposed to chuck watson  dynegy  s chairman and chief executive  that he get two  thirds of what he was due in a noncash payment  such as stock in the merged company 
with half of the noncash payment  lay wanted to set up a foundation to provide assistance to enron employees in need 
a significant portion of the rest  according to his plan  would have been cash to cover taxes 
dynegy declined immediate comment about lay  s tuesday decision 
but carol coale  an analyst with prudential securities in houston  quipped   that might stave off one shareholder lawsuit

enron offers reasons for selling to dynegy
underperforming assets  heavy debt cited
by laura goldberg
copyright  houston chronicle
among enron corp   s reasons for agreeing to be bought out by rival dynegy  underperforming assets were draining cash and earnings  and debt load was stretching the company 
that enron faced a loss of confidence from financial markets and departures of some senior executives also played into the decision  documents filed by enron on tuesday with federal securities regulators said 
before agreeing to a merger with dynegy  enron also considered staying independent  an infusion of private equity and an infusion from a strategic partner 
friday  the two companies announced dynegy would buy enron for almost   billion in stock plus the assumption of almost   billion in debt and   billion in preferred stock 
under the deal  enron shareholders get    share of dynegy per enron share  the ratio is subject to  downward revision  under certain circumstances  the documents said 
also  chevrontexaco  a dynegy shareholder  gave dynegy     billion  dynegy on tuesday injected that money into enron  aiming to shore up its core energy trading operation 
in return for the money  dynegy gets preferred stock and other rights in enron  s northern natural gas pipeline system  if the deal doesn  t close  dynegy could buy all of northern natural gas  which includes about    miles of natural gas pipeline 
the filings say dynegy  s right to buy northern natural gas is first subject to a right of enron to repurchase northern natural gas  if the merger should not close  dynegy  under certain circumstances  has the option instead to convert its stake in northern natural gas to enron stock 
also of note in the documents 
 enron will finish its second downtown office tower  now under construction  and will keep moving employees into the new building  at this time  
 the merged company will assume the  rights and obligations  under enron  s naming  rights deal for enron field 
enron also made filings with the securities and exchange commission concerning agreements announced nov   to get   billion in credit lines from j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup 
the filing detailed a provision in those agreements that  based on enron  s current credit rating  would have prevented it from tapping those lines  an enron spokesman said tuesday the banks have waived that provision 
also tuesday  enron said it named company executive raymond bowen jr  as treasurer to replace ben glisan  who was fired last week 
dynegy stock continued its upward movement tuesday  closing     higher at

houston   enron corp  chairman and chief executive officer kenneth lay stands to receive up to      million  u  s   once the top buyer and seller of natural gas in the united states is merged into its smaller  but stronger rival dynegy inc 
dynegy  s purchase of enron  worth at least      billion in stock  would trigger a clause in mr  lay  s contract that gives him a lump sum of      million for each full calendar year remaining in his contract if there is a change in control of enron  according to documents filed yesterday with the u  s  securities and exchange commission

 that  s a ridiculous amount of money for a man who  s already made himself probably tens of millions of dollars   said andrew whalley  manager of the legg mason international utilities trust  which sold a    million stake in enron in april because of concern about its bookkeeping 
 it  s a classic golden parachute   said raymond james analyst jon kyle cartwright  noting that it is comparable to financial safety nets in other top corporate contracts 
but shareholders might not appreciate the parachute given the once  mighty company  s recent troubles  mr  cartwright said 
 that  s a tough call   he said   it certainly would have been fair if you had been looking at enron up to a couple of months ago  following that it gets dicey  and i  m not sure how shareholders are going to take it

mark to market  retail sales to surge on free money

a dow jones newswires column
new york   dow jones   professionals and amateurs alike agree that at    a  m  est the commerce department will report that u  s  retail sales rose in october 
some observers believe that retail sales not only rose last month  but that they surged      being the top of the forecast range 
all again agree that the main stimulant was the zero  percent financing offered by the major automakers 
in september  sadness and other negative emotions engendered by the events of    helped to fashion a     drop in overall retail sales and a     decline when auto sales were excluded 
the dow jones newswires median forecast of  economists has it that overall retail sales rose     in october  while they were ahead only     when auto sales were excluded 
while it is difficult to believe that any market will move lower in response to a notable improvement in retail sales  the most compelling ways in which the report can be  spun  are all negative 
a few examples  the october increase will be from a depressed september level 
yes  october retail sales were goosed by zero  percent financing  but november won  t get such a lift even though the zero  percent sales campaign isn  t over yet 
that  s because even if  free  money lured me out of my shell and into the showroom in october  it will have no effect on me in november or in december  i already bought a new car  unless i  m a rich collector  that  s it for at least year or two 
the more metaphysical of commentators will also note that many october car sales spurred by zero  percent financing were  in a very real sense  stolen from subsequent months  without  free  money  i might  for example  have waited until april of  before buying a new car 
then  too  there is the cost to the automakers of the zero  interest loans  gm  s general motors acceptance corp   which finances the parent  s cars  will remain a profit center  but it won  t be from auto loans made in october 
i  ll leave the summing to a professional  because i agree with him  
 retail sales probably reversed the plunge in september  although mainly because of a spike in autos that is unlikely to be sustained for more than one month   said jim o  sullivan  economist at ubs warburg 
vienna meeting overshadowed
oil ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting ministers began meeting today in vienna 
most oil traders are looking for them to cut daily output by around    million barrels  but who ever really knows with opec  which i have cleverly punned  more than once  into opaque 
besides there  s a war going on in afghanistan and oil  rich iraq may be next  and who knows but that the house of saud won  t be toppled by islamic fundamentalists  to name but a few topics that are more compelling than a periodic quota buck  and  wing by opec 
would you believe the enron award 
i told you in tuesday  s mornings m  m that i failed after searching for an hour to find out what fed chairman greenspan was doing at rice university tuesday evening 
wouldn  t you just know it  i found out this morning what mr  greenspan was doing in a dispatch from the associated press  he went to rice to receive the enron prize for distinguished public service from the university  s baker institute for public policy  enron will be taken over by dynegy inc  so this will probably be the final enron award  and no i  m not going to avail myself of a handy invitation to irony 
mr  greenspan had some things of interest to say to the folks at rice  but none that we haven  t heard from him before  such as      there is no evidence that we have  in this process of events since march of the year   significantly altered the long  term underlying structure of productivity growth  
with all due respect  al  productivity growth is not likely to be exponential as in a nuclear reaction  but appears tied to earth by the law of diminishing returns 
the big guy is on the stump again today 
mr  greenspan gives the keynote address at an  economic forum  in washington d  c  sponsored by the board of directors of the u  s  chamber of commerce 
dow jones newswires says the speech begins at    p  m  est  that  s our story and we  re sticking to it 
another major wire service says  depending on which calendar or story you look at  that the speech begins at both    p  m  and    p  m  in this business  mistakes are made 
anyhow  no big deal  if you might need to hear what the big guy might say just begin paying attention at    p  m

you move a step forward and you are a sucker  you move a step backward and you are a sucker still  that just about sums up indias predicament in trying to get one  time us energy trading giant enron off its back and off the    mw dabhol power plant for some time now 
for the past fortnight or so  the institutions have been bargaining hard to find a buyer for enrons assets in maharashtra  having committed over rs    crore in loans  last weekend  they even went into a huddle in singapore to sew up the loose ends of a bail  out 
little seems to have been thrashed out so far  little possibly will  unless  of course  the fis tighten the screws with a take  it or leave  it offer  the time to make that choice is now 
a gentleman in pin  stripes whos done a lot of running around these past few weeks to help sew up the deal  told me the other day that enron had indeed agreed to part with its stake in dpc at a  per cent discount 
that would have fetched it just about    odd million spread over a five  year period  so  why hasnt a deal been struck 
its probably not worked out because of what enron considers a fair discount on what it has sunk into the project  prospective buyers consider this too high an asking price 
for the record  enron claims to have sunk in     billion in the project together with its partners ge and bechtel who have supplied equipment and helped construct the plant 
but my gentleman friend in pin  stripes suggests that     billion isnt exactly their equity contribution in dabhol  that amount works out to just about   million 
enron  actually splurged close to   million on development expenses  which in gentlemens lingo is another way of saying that the energy giant could have ended up bribing its way to see the once coveted project through besides fighting sundry court cases in india 
and it wants part of that money back  now which prospective buyer will compensate enron for possible bribes or for making court appearances 
enron  it appears  has also claimed another   million as its share of dabhols retained earnings  which should eventually go to all stake  holders in dpc  the mseb included  once the companys board passes a resolution that the amount is shared proportionately among all those who have invested in dabhols equity capital  till then  leave the retained earnings aside 
so  what enron should work on is a fair discount on its equity contribution in the project  which is no more than   million  now given its willingness to take a  per cent knock  enron should not expect more than   million as the asking price for walking out of dabhol 
add to that  if you will  another   million by way of retained earnings and enron should not be getting more than   million at the most  is enron willing to take this knock 
given a choice  it could resist this offer  but enron has no choice  and thats reason for cheer  last week  enron  close to the present american dispensation  chairman ken lay was the biggest fund  raiser for president george bushs campaign effort last year  opted for a     billion rescue offer from smaller houston rival dynegy after narrowly escaping credit ratings cut to junk status 
for the past several months enron had been using its clout with mr bush to push through a bail  out package on dabhol that suited its terms  that privilege now seems to be gone as the company grapples to stave off a securities exchange commission inquiry into off  balancesheet transactions 
and until enron clears several questions back home about its finances  it will remain suspect in the eyes of us investors 
in india  where enrons made more news for its misses than its hits  the timing couldnt have been more opportune than now for prospective private bidders to strike a potentially lucrative deal 
two such bidders  tata power and bses  are said to have offered no more than   million to buy out enrons stake in dpc  its time they stuck to that price  or else  we could still end up being suckers  what

when three top enron corp  executives proposed a merger to one of his lieutenants two weeks ago  no one needed to tell chuck watson that enron was desperate 
the founder and chairman of dynegy inc  is a wily old energy trader  he can smell desperate two oil fields away  or three city blocks away  as was the case between these houston rivals 
a liquidity crisis threatened to reduce enron  s credit rating to junk status  wall street analysts were hostile after disclosures about conflicts of interest and huge losses on outside trading partnerships  investors had fled 
when the approach came  watson didn  t jump  he sat  he sent word to have enron chief executive kenneth lay call him if the offer was serious 
a nice negotiating move  for sure  watson put the seller at a minor tactical disadvantage  but watson adds a kindlier spin  he didn  t want to appear to be pouncing on enron  s troubles 
two weeks of negotiations and demi  due  diligence later  watson and lay had their deal  dynegy would buy enron  a company three times its size  in a   billion deal 
watson takes satisfaction that dynegy  the company that was always smaller and stodgier than enron  became the buyer  most of his career  watson has operated in enron  s shadow 
the two companies were formed the same year    after  years at conoco  watson persuaded morgan stanley to give him a line of credit to form a small energy trading company  lay  meanwhile  engineered the merger of houston natural gas and internorth of omaha 
 ken put two pipelines together to make that company  i had six people and a smile   watson told me during the chicago stop of an east coast  to  texas barnstorming to sell the deal to investors 
enron was always the bigger glamor play  lay  s move from a base of trading natural gas and electric power into the engineering of exotic financial deals in areas as diverse as communications bandwidth  paper  steel and media won a huge wall street following and doubled enron  s stock price last year  to above   a share 
dynegy by contrast seemed downright dull  though it dabbled in broadband communications  dynegy stuck mainly to the business of generating  trading and delivering gas and electricity  though dynegy  s stock price nearly quadrupled last year to    dynegy never turned heads the way enron did 
today  enron has no friends left  the messy breakdown of enron  s trades with outside partnerships has forced it into dynegy  s embrace  watson thinks wall street went hard on enron because of the company  s high  handed manner when it was on top   if you have that personality and things go wrong  i mean  everybody  s going to take your legs off   watson says 
this would be a tidy tortoise  and  hare tale except for one thing  enron  s problems are such a mess  they could make for rough going at dynegy  too 
watson thinks he has protected himself  he can walk from the deal if enron  s legal entanglements exceed     billion  if  on the other hand  enron  s problems don  t get worse and other bidders emerge  he gets a healthy   million break  up fee and ownership of a key enron pipeline 
that  s better than nothing  but it  s hardly a failsafe  some enron trades with the outside partnerships don  t unwind for years  so problems might not emerge until after dynegy has closed its deal 
there are more mainstream challenges  too 
roughly half of enron  s operating profits last year came from off  balance sheet transactions watson wants to eliminate  replacing that won  t be easy  and watson needs to handle at least   billion in enron debt 
enron  s high rollers might not fit into dynegy  s careful culture  watson  s team also must stretch to run a company that  even with divestitures  will jump to at least three times dynegy  s current size 
watson  s personality can be aw  shucks disarming  born at great lakes naval air station in illinois  the son of a navy officer  he lived in  places before he graduated high school  now  if he closes the deal  he  ll be running one of the country  s largest companies 
no one would get a kick from taking watson down a notch  but that hardly means investors won  t knock him if he can  t make the enron deal work

the downfall of energy  trading titan enron corp  was the result of  bad business practices  rather than illegal activity  says chuck watson  chief executive of dynegy inc   the company acquiring enron in a deal valued at   billion 
 i  m not persuaded that you  ll find anything illegal   watson said tuesday  commenting on the securities and exchange commission  s probe into enron  s off  balance sheet transactions in energy partnerships 
watson  s comments came as enron  in a filing with the sec  disclosed that kenneth lay  the company  s chairman and chief executive  could walk away with a golden parachute worth more than   million if the merger succeeds  under terms of a pre  existing employment contract  lay would receive     million a year for each full year outstanding on his contract if control of enron changes hands during his employment 
at the same time  enron issued a letter to employees warning that the deal with dynegy was likely to result in workforce reductions at enron   as with any merger   the letter said   some elimination of positions is almost inevitable  
enron  the nation  s largest trader of natural gas and electricity  has seen its stock price collapse in recent weeks largely because of soured transactions with energy partnerships run by one of its former executives and additional revelations about questionable accounting practices at enron 
power  trading rival dynegy  owner of downstate utility illinois power  moved last week to acquire its hobbled competitor  agreeing to pay the equivalent of about   a share for a company that as recently as last january traded above   a share 
in a wide  ranging interview  watson criticized the practice at dynegy of permitting enron executives to sit on the partnership boards and profit from them   you don  t let that happen   watson said   it would never have gotten by me  
watson sees the distinction between illegal conduct and bad judgment at enron as significant because the absence of illegality would minimize grounds for shareholder lawsuits 
dynegy has said the merger is contingent on litigation costs over enron  s problems staying under     billion   i don  t think it  s going to be anywhere near that level   watson said 
enron  s misfortunes  watson said  paved the way for dynegy  s opportunity   this is all about brand   he said   they lost credibility and investor confidence  
dynegy  s takeover of its higher  profile rival is a coup for dynegy  which has been viewed by some as an  enron wannabe   but watson brushed off the description   that  s actually not true   watson said   it  s clearly not true now  
watson asserted that nothing had gone wrong with enron  s core businesses  that fact  he said  had been lost   by investors and potential enron suitors   in the controversy surrounding the off  balance sheet transactions 
 maybe the tires fell off the car and the paint was chipped  but the engine was still strong   watson said  referring to enron  s core businesses 
in an apparent conundrum  dynegy  s bid for enron at what is viewed as a bargain basement price has not brought any other companies to the bargaining table  enron  s problems reportedly scared off some prospective bidders  such as warren buffett  s berkshire hathaway 
watson argued that dynegy was uniquely positioned to pursue the enron deal  in large part because the rivals had extensive business dealings together 
 it took our guys days   not months   to do due diligence   watson said   we were right there in town  it was the time factor  the knowledge that we had of the industry and the business  
for example  watson said shell oil co   another company thought to have an interest in acquiring enron  would not have had the background to move as quickly as dynegy had in putting together the merger 
while saying that he had respect for the regulatory approval process  watson reiterated his belief that the merger posed no antitrust concerns   we don  t have a pipeline business  they do   watson said   they don  t have a generation business  we do

usa  update   calpers calls on enron board to step aside in merger 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
pasadena  calif   nov   reuters   the largest u  s  pension fund said on tuesday the board of energy trader enron corp should step aside if the company moves forward with its plans to be bought by dynegy inc
the california public employees retirement system  calpers  said it would oppose any efforts by enron to place its current board members on the new board of a company resulting from the proposed   billion stock  swap merger announced on friday 
calpers owns about  million enron shares  or about    percent of all shares outstanding  however  the public pension fund is widely watched for its stances on corporate governance 
the merger would value houston  based enron at a fraction of what it was worth a year ago  the shares have lost  percent of their value over the past  weeks 
a spokesman from calpers and a spokeswoman from enron could not be reached for comment 
in declaring its position on the merger  calpers cited reports that enron was seeking the right to appoint three of its current board members to the combined company  s board 
enron in recent weeks has reshuffled its management in response to a u  s  regulatory probe into murky financial transactions  the company has said that former chief financial officer andrew fastow  who abruptly left the company last month  had made   million managing limited partnerships that conducted outside transactions with enron 
 there have been serious allegations of self  dealing on the part of enron  s senior management   michael flaherman  chair of calpers investment committee  said after a meeting of the pension  s administrative board   and it appears that enron  s board may have failed in its responsibility to monitor the activities of enron  s corporate officers  
 until all of these issues are sorted out   he continued   the interests of shareholders are best served by retiring all of the current directors from involvement in enron  s successor entities  
california state officials and enron clashed last year over the state  s power crisis  which triggered the bankruptcy of california  s largest utility pacific gas  electric  a unit of san francisco  based pg  e corp
california gov  gray davis and others blasted enron and other state power companies  accusing them of manipulating the market and jacking up prices 
enron is by far the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the united states  with analysts estimating it is involved in some  percent of the daily trades in those markets 
calpers said it also has a stake in houston  based dynegy but it did not provide details on that investment

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan was in houston on tuesday night to pick up the enron prize for distinguished public service  an award named for the teetering energy company that is being bought by rival dynegy inc  for about   billion 
at one point greenspan expounded on the values of ethicism to the rice university crowd while ken lay  whose company has been blasted on wall street for concealing transactions with entities run by the company  s chief financial officer  looked on 
 my experience is that it really works to be as ethical as possible as one knows and to define one  s values in a very succinct and important way   greenspan said when asked by a pending college graduate about venturing into the work world 
lay  in his first major public appearance since the merger announcement  was met with warm applause and made some brief congratulatory remarks 
no mention was made of enron  s current woes or lay  s decision earlier in the day to waive about   million he would be due as the merger closes 
past winners of the enron prize  awarded by the baker institute for public policy at rice  include colin powell  nelson mandela and mikhail gorbachev

jesse jackson asks energy companies to hire more minorities

associated press
houston   the energy industry has an untapped resource in minorities who traditionally have been overlooked by big business  including the energy sector  the rev  jesse jackson said tuesday 
mr  jackson has been in houston   dubbed the nation  s energy capital   for two days  bringing together more than  representatives of minority  owned businesses with those running some of the nation  s largest energy companies at his inaugural wall street project energy summit 
 we do not have a talent shortage   mr  jackson told the minority business owners who sat in on a discussion with representatives from enron corp   ene   dynegy inc   dyn  and shell oil co   rd    we have an opportunity shortage  
mr  jackson  speaking at a hotel just down the street from the headquarters of troubled enron  said now was the time for minorities to make their presence known with the proposed dynegy purchase of enron  its larger rival  he said spinoff companies and other opportunities created by the proposed merger  as well as deregulation of the texas energy market  offer possibilities for those who possess knowledge of the changing industry 
 the question is not  can we produce   the question is  can they see our capacity to produce    mr  jackson said   we are a knowledgeable people  we have a low profile  but we have a place in the industry  
energy company representatives agreed  the question for them  however  was how to change what has become business as usual  they said 
 most ceos who do business in corporate america are comfortable with who they do business with   said milton scott  dynegy  s chief administrative officer and senior vice president   many of them are not inherently racist  
 i would call it racism  years ago   mr  jackson replied   today i would call it cultural blindness and part of our job is to take the patch off their eye  
gaurdie bannister  shell oil  s vice president of business development  said there are a number of individuals in large companies who are willing to  break eggs  with minority  owned businesses but often run into roadblocks because those companies are unable to cushion a large risk that would be taken  for example  in an offshore project 
 if you are not big and you don  t have the capital to take that risk with me  i can  t use you   he said 
mr  scott said a way for smaller minority  owned businesses to get around such obstacles and get the big contracts is to combine their strengths 
 join forces   he said   set your egos aside and you are going to have a lot more success because then you take away some of the risk  
reducing risk isn  t the goal  mr  jackson said  instead  it  s a level playing field for everyone

usa  enron earnings restatement a sign of deceit  suits 
by david howard sinkman
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
new york  nov   reuters   lawyers filing lawsuits against enron corp  on tuesday said the restatement last week of more than four years of earnings is a clear sign the energy trader and its chief executives misled investors 
at least  law firms are seeking class action status on behalf of plaintiffs they said were deceived by false and misleading statements or because adverse information was concealed  causing enron  s shares to be artificially inflated 
 enron restating its earnings is certainly going to help our case  it demonstrates that in their opinion their earnings were false when initially published   said lawyer arthur stock of berger  montague pc in philadelphia  one of the law firms seeking class  action status 
enron declined to comment 
the lawsuits name the company  chairman and chief executive kenneth lay  former ceo jeffrey skilling and andrew fastow  a former chief financial officer  as defendants 
in another blow to its damaged reputation among investors  the houston  based company last week admitted it erred in reporting past results  it reduced its earnings from  to  by   million  or  percent of the amount that had previously been released on its financial statements  earnings for the first two quarters of  also were restated 
enron has garnered investor ire since it unexpectedly reduced shareholder equity by     billion in mid  october  saying off  balance sheet transactions had contributed to that and to   billion in charges 
the company  s stock plunged as almost daily developments sullied investors  it lost almost  percent of value from the day the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on oct    to the announcement last week that rival dynegy inc  would buy enron for about   billion in stock and the assumption of about   billion in debt 
enron shares closed tuesday  cents higher at     on the new york stock exchange  far off its august  high of     
increased time frame
in the latest lawsuit to be filed against enron since it was rocked by a u  s  regulatory probe in october  the law firm of cauley geller bowman  coates said misrepresentations and omissions by the defendants violated their duty to release accurate and truthful information on the company  s finances 
 each of the defendants is liable as a participant in a fraudulent scheme and course of business that operated as a fraud or deceit on purchasers of enron common stock by disseminating materially false and misleading statements   said cauley geller in a lawsuit filed in texarkana  texas 
the suit was filed nov    the day after the restated earnings were released  in the u  s  district court for the eastern district of texas 
prior to the restatement of results  prompted by concerns raised by the u  s  securities and exchange commission  the lawsuits filed against enron were on the behalf of shareholders who bought common stock between jan     and oct   
however  since enron restated its results  cauley geller increased the time frame  or  class period  on behalf of investors who bought enron stock  from jan     to nov   
 the effect of the restatement was dramatic   said cauley geller   enron insiders disposed of over   million of their personally held enron common stock to unsuspecting investors  
cauley geller said selling of enron stock by key executives was  unusual and suspicious given its timing   lay sold     million worth of shares during the period  and skilling sold     million in stock  the law firm said 
 people who have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars are naturally angry  stock said   it is expected in this type of situation  
in a filing with the sec on tuesday  it was reported lay could walk away with more than   million if the acquisiton by dnyegy closes this year

usa  s  p says dynegy deal saves enron from junk rating 
by nancy leinfuss
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
new york  nov   reuters   enron corp   teetering on the brink of junk status  got a reprieve late friday when standard  poor  s cut the troubled energy trading company  s credit ratings but stopped a notch short of the speculative  grade category  after news of its potential acquisition by dynegy inc 
 the way to look at the dynegy transaction is it really in a sense maintains the investment  grade quality to enron  s credit rating   said todd shipman  analyst at s  p   it  s safe to say that absent a dynegy deal  enron was quite likely to end up non  investment  grade quality because of what had happened   shipman said 
enron  the nation  s largest energy trader  has been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and falling credit ratings in the past month following disclosures of off  balance sheet deals now under investigation by the u  s  securities and exchange commission for possible conflict of interest 
s  p lowered its long  term corporate credit rating on enron to bbb  minus from bbb  its lowest investment  grade rating  a cut below that  to junk  would make it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day  to  day business 
the rating agency also placed the ratings of dynegy on creditwatch negative after the energy provider said it had agreed to acquire enron for about     billion 
terms of the dynegy transaction call for dynegy to swap    shares of its own stock for each enron share  the companies said  that would value houston  based enron at     per share  including convertible stock  a premium of about  percent over friday  s closing price of     
the takeover announcement halted a free  fall in enron  s stock  which has lost about  percent of its market capitalization in the past month  on tuesday   enron shares closed at      up     cents  or    percent  on the new york stock exchange 
enron  s debt  which has been trading at levels associated with higher  risk junk bonds  moved higher on the news  the company  s    percent notes due  were traded at  cents on the dollar  up from the mid    s range last week  traders said 
industry experts said the most critical component of the deal was an immediate cash infusion by dynegy shareholder chevrontexaco into enron 
chevrontexaco  which owns a  percent stake in dynegy  has agreed to infuse     billion immediately into enron to support it until the deal closes  it would inject another   billion into the merged company once the deal closes 
 that was an important part of that whole deal  not just dynegy coming in and offering money to buy enron out  but also providing that up  front liquidity to protect the value of enron  s trading business  which is really the crown jewel  so to speak  that dynegy is interested in   said shipman 
s  p said dynegy  s corporate credit rating is likely to remain within the bbb category  as a result of its purchase of enron   we saw an investment  grade company  within a range of bbb  plus to bbb   said shipman   if things go as planned  dynegy would keep its credit rating  
s  p said it will continue to monitor the planned acquisition by dynegy of enron and warned that a downgrade to junk status for enron would be likely if the transaction is not completed 
 the main thing we  ll be monitoring at this point is enron  s liquidity and the value of its trading franchise  because that  s really what dynegy is interested in   said shipman 
 if there were to be an effect on enron  s trading business that would be significant enough to reduce dynegy  s interest in enron  that would raise the possibility that the merger would not be completed  then the possibility of downgrade would be very strong for enron   shipman said 
moody  s investors service  another major u  s  rating agency  could not immediately be reached for comment on any potential rating actions after news of enron  s buyout by dynegy  moody  s rates enron debt in line with s  p  at  baa    its lowest investment  grade rating 
enron  with   billion in revenues and   billion in profits last year  is fifth on fortune   s list of largest u  s  companies  dynegy   th on the fortune list  had   billion in revenues and   million in earnings

earlier today  lay planned to propose to dynegy that he take

dynegy stock and use half of the stock to set up a fund to provide

up to dynegy to decide if a fund should be set up for former enron
