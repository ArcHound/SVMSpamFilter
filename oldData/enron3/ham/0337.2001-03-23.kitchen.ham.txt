this is more than you ever wanted to know about catalytica  if there is any point to regurgitating it  that point would be that this deal didn  t make a dime for enron  ge got a  gift   as i would see it  of   million from enron  and catalytica got off scot  free 
the december  dash summarized the eight agreements associated with the transactions to  permit the following     sale and repurchase of the spark spread option     funding xonon development in an amount equal to the proceeds of the option sale     funding the turbine prepayment at the pastoria project with the same option sale proceeds     obtaining the right of first refusal on the first five commercial  fas equipped with xonon  and    purchase of the turbines on an off  balance sheet basis  enhancing the value of the equity investment in catalytica was mentioned as a strategic benefit and potential upside  turbine overpricing was not mentioned in the dash or the risk matrix 
when dave added his comments to the may  dash i understood that the   million cost was intended to be offset by   million in turbine credits  doing an allocation of the cost seemed logically to mean allocation of the credits once they were recognised  outside of the slim chance that something blew up  the allocated cost would be offset with a subsequently allocated credit  i  e  a wash 
from an ena perspective the issue is moot  if the decision is to allocate a portion of the turbine overpricing to the merchant portfolio but none of the credits  that clearly was not accounted for in  or  and certainly was not provided for in the  merchant asset management plan

chris  thanks for the clarification  pat did confirm with sheila that the turbines were overpriced    which seems to mean that enron ended up giving ge a gift of   million  that seems strange  it also still seems to me that the december  dash did not accurately reflect the deal  unless i missed it  i did not find any reference to turbine overpricing 
my understanding of dave  s comment on the may  dash was to account for the acceleration period between may and september  and the risk that the pastoria project would be cancelled and  or the technology development fail in that period  in may ena gave up the opportunity to stick catalytica with  credits  as payment for the repurchase of the sso rather than cash if either of these events occured before september  and thereby lost the optionality of the four months  the may  transaction did not change the economics of the deal in any other way than this acceleration  if the comment was intended to allocate the turbine overpricing which was part of the  original transaction  i agree with you that this should have been handled at that time 
my concern has been that enron retain the  benefit  of the credits referenced in the xtia which apparently has occurred  however  the fact apparently is that the credits had been rendered valueless from the start by the turbine overpricing 
my framework had been that as long as enron received the credits in some form  the may  transaction was a wash as far as i was concerned

sounds as though this caught you by surprise  sorry for that  your chronology seems correct  this thing makes my head hurt every time it is brought up  i believe the obligation was incurred dec   but not properly recognized  accounted for until the may   dash  delainey  s hand  written note was the end result of people dissecting the deals with the realization that the west power turbines were overpriced by the     mm and the catalytica equity account did not properly account for that in dec  
the turbine contract refers to a credit of     mm but the gross turbine price was increased by twice that amount so that the net increase was     mm  ena agreed to it because piper wanted to help catalytica  despite much protest from dave parquet  i agreed with delainey and ray bowen that west power would be on the hook for     mm of the     mm because the project got some benefit from catalytica  delainey wanted the payment triggered on sale of pastoria because he did not want my group to recognize any income until the project closed  this was communicated to and acknowledged by accounting and i reminded them of it every month or two since mid  year 
i understand pat called sheila tweed  i dont think she  or anyone  remembers the details  but she should be able to validate the point about turbine overpricing and the delainey fix in may

chris  i couldn  t agree more about the confusing history of the catalytica xtia and spark spread derivative transactions  my understanding is slightly different from what you outline but you may have better sources  neither of us were present at the creation 
i am familiar with dave delainey  s hand  written note on the may    dash  that dash authorised accelerating repurchase of the sso by three months  my view is that dave could allocate within ena at his discretion  i did not understand the rationale  however  since it was the december    dash which established the obligation for enron to fund the     million  all the may    dash did was unwind a financing arrangement three months early  it did not have anything to do with the incurrence of the obligation itself 
the objective of the complex series of agreements was for enron to finance ge  s development of the xonon technology and in return receive credits on turbine purchases either at pastoria or for other xonon  equiped turbines if pastoria were cancelled 
original deal
  catalytica agreed to purchase a spark spread option  sso  from enron for     million payable in four instalments  these instalments exactly matched the funding obligation to ge under the xtia 
  catalytica actually paid enron   million which represented the first two instalments 
  west lb made   million milestone payments to ge  the enron  west lp arrangement was an off balance sheet financing deal  at the end of the day  enron was paying ge 
  by september    enron was obligated to repurchase the sso from catalytica for the amount catalytica had paid enron or for turbine credits if pastoria were cancelled 
may  sso repurchase
  enron bought back the sso from catalytica for   million  the three  month acceleration of repurchase was supposed to facilitate an ipo  it did not impact at all enron  s ultimate obligation which had always been for the full     million 
catalytica was now out of the chain and had no further payment obligations or credit entitlements 
december  final milestone payment to ge
  enron has paid ge     million through the west lb financing arrangement  now turbo park 
i am uncertain whether ge increased the price of the pastoria turbines by     million as part of these transactions  my understanding was that there was concern about this when the turbine contract was negotiated  but i had thought this concern was to be guarded against in contract negotiation with ge  if in fact ge did increase the cost of the pastoria turbines by     million the entire purpose and benefit to enron from these incredibly complex and non  intuitive documents was totally obviated  net  net enron would have paid ge to develop a technology application with no compensatory value  why enron would have done this kind of deal i don  t know 
i  m not sure what internal income transfer would apply  i understand that ge has applied the     million credit against a progress payment billing late last year  wouldn  t this mean that the full credit was taken by pastoria  it is unclear to me why the sale of pastoria should trigger anything 
at the end of the day ena did the deal in  and how we account for the consequences now is irrelevant  if the turbines were overpriced  the december    dash seems to me to be misleading in not disclosing that fact when approval was requested  the dash actually states that the     million would  serve as a down payment for the pastoria turbine package  
my summary may not be correct but this is the best i have been able to piece together on what happened  dick

calpine reduced their purchase price because the turbine contract for pastoria was overpriced by     mm  the amount of the catalytica credit 
a brief confusing history as i understand it    ena east and west jointly owned the catalytica equity account in   it was written up based on expectations of an ipo value  at    it transferred to west power because catalytica entered into an agreement with pastoria to provide the project with its zonon technology  this agreement included a commitment from ge to do research  work in order to use the catalytica technology on ge turbines  the cost of this      mm  was added to the pastoria turbine contract 
in feb   when i arrived in portland  i had the catalytica account transferred to the portfolio because i thought it was overvalued with little synergies with ena west power  in mid   the agreement was restructured in order to  clean up  catalytica so it could ipo  at that time  enron was credited back the     mm from catalytica and it was decided by delainey that that amount should be split     pastoria and    catalytica equity  with the    going to ena west power upon the sale of pastoria  pastoria did not get the full     mm back because we benefited somewhat from favourable publicity and some interest savings 
at this time  since there is no funds transfer  i believe it simply becomes an internal income transfer from the merchant portfolio to ena west power

what happens under the pastoria deal to the catalytica credit  did it go to calpine or are you using it in the other turbine purchases
