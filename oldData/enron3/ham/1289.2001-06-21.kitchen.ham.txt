subject  re  new albany purchase and sale agreement
three minute conversation  he is all done as far as he is concerned  i did ask him on any issues he did say they wanted to shorten the right to match less than  months  but that was only in passing 
he also said the board will not even be discussing this but just wave it through under any other business 
that  s it
