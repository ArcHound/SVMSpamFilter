fitch places marlin water trust ii  osprey trust i on rtg watch neg
fitch  ny  october     fitch has placed the ratings of
marlin water trust ii  s  marlin ii  s  approximately   million
senior secured notes due   and osprey trust  s  osprey  s 
approximately     billion senior secured notes due  on
rating watch negative  the marlin ii notes and the osprey notes
are currently rated  bbb   this rating action follows the
placing of enron corp   s ratings on rating watch negative by
fitch 
the rating of the marlin ii notes is supported by an overfund
account  pre  funded interest  and equity commitment from enron
in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock  the
overfund account is invested in enron debt securities  rated
 bbb    rating watch negative   with payments used to service
interest to noteholders  payment of principal ultimately relies
on enron  s obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible
preferred securities  fitch currently rates enron  s preferred
securities  bbb    rating watch negative  in addition  the
transaction also benefits from rights under a   million loan
to azurix europe limited  rated  bbb   by fitch 
similarly  the rating of the osprey i notes is based on the
support from the assets in the share trust used to support
interest payments and an equity commitment from enron to
remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund
principal payments  the mandatorily convertible preferred stock
has been issued and is being held in the share trust  the assets
in the share trust supporting interest payments include enron
unsecured obligations  the overfund account  as well as
quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible
preferred stock 
while various sources of repayment exist  such as sale or
liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering  in
each case primary credit support is derived from the enron
obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock
if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been
deposited with the trustee the   day prior to the maturity
date  which is one of the note trigger events  in the event that
the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount
required to redeem the senior notes  enron is required to
deliver additional shares  if enron cannot or does not deliver
on this obligation  subject to certain standstill periods  then
the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of
enron  representing a general unsecured claim  additional note
trigger events include a downgrade of enron  s senior unsecured
debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies
in conjunction with specified declines in enron  s closing stock
price over three consecutive trading days  as well as customary
events of default under the notes  it is important to note that
enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt 
fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction
with the ratings of enron  corp  and will update investors as
appropriate

that was well before enron ran into its current market turmoil  last week  the company reported a   million third quarter loss and     billion reduction in shareholder equity  the company has said that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with andrew s  fastow  its former chief financial officer who was replaced on wednesday

enron unit takes heat power group says energy firm failed bond requirements

the retail sales subsidiary of houston energy giant enron corp  faced expulsion last week from the new england group representing power generators  marketers and distributors  the sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills 
iso new england  which operates the power grid throughout the six new england states  urged nepool  the power industry group  to  initiate termination proceedings  for enron energy services inc   according to a letter obtained by the globe 
an enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied nepool  s requirements  and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights  including the failure of iso new england to warn enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels 
 it was an administrative snafu   said peggy mahoney  a spokeswoman for enron   it  s fixed  it  s no big deal  we didn  t get the paperwork in  on time  because it got sent to the wrong desk  it was taken care of on friday  
according to the letter  a nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous  months   having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently   said ellen foley  an iso new england spokeswoman  in the letter  iso  s chief financial officer  edward mckenna  said his organization  has been in contact with enron energy services through multiple telephone communications  and to date the financial assurance has not been cured  
but mahoney said enron never received written notification of its previous  financial assurance  defaults  which were corrected almost immediately  therefore  she said  the company was unaware that the current default was the third  which begins the expulsion proceeding  in addition  she said  the current default notice was sent to the wrong person  creating the delay that resulted in the letter   we  re working with iso new england to figure that out   she said 
the recommended termination is an embarrassment to enron because the firm  s director of state government affairs  daniel w  allegretti  is the chairman of nepool  s participant committee  which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization 
 this is not that unusual within the pool   said allegretti   i frequently receive notices of technical defaults   as far as posting the new bond to correct the situation  he said   we were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork  
the incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for enron  the parent in houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm  s chief financial officer  andrew s  fastow  is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with enron  the securities and exchange commission is probing those transactions  the company said monday  enron placed fastow on leave tuesday and installed a new cfo 
enron  s stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company  s financial strength  the company reduced shareholder equity by     billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by fastow  according to the wall street journal  enron lost   million in the third quarter 
yesterday  enron  s shares closed at      down  cents  on volume of    million shares

enron has put up a page on its website of  frequently asked questions  in response to a barrage of analysts  enquiries following last week  s controversial results announcement 
unfortunately  the us energy group  s critics have not been satisfied with the answers  nor has wednesday  s decision to replace andrew fastow  its chief financial officer  quelled all investors  concerns about its highly complex financial affairs 
however  analysts are pleased that kenneth lay  chief executive officer  is distancing the group from mr fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle  partnerships    it is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move   says ronald barone of ubs warburg   it  s not the end of it  
the shares  which have tumbled since last week  s results  ended a shade lower yesterday  off    per cent at dollars     but analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the   week high of dollars    until the group improves its transparency 
one of the frequently asked questions following enron  s results announcement on october  concerned  a dollars    bn  pounds  m  reduction in shareholders  equity   the dollars    bn was not explained in the news release on the results  but mentioned in passing by mr lay in a follow  up conference call  many analysts confused it with a dollars    bn charge in the earnings report 
it has since been called a  loss  and a  write  off  and enron  s staff have struggled to explain it in plain language 
enron  s official position now is that the reduction in shareholders  equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which ljm  a private equity fund formed by mr fastow  was an investor  when the decision was made to terminate these vehicles  enron  recorded a dollars    bn reduction in shareholders  equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables  these adjustments were the result of enron  s termination of obligations to deliver enron shares in future periods  
the confusion over the dollars    bn has further undermined the credibility of enron  which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission 
analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group  s debt ratio  which might hurt its debt rating 
mr lay held an analysts  meeting to counter charges that enron was not transparent  but this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts   i find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions   said goldman sachs  david fleischer 
other analysts are also concerned about potential further write  offs  salomon smith barney  s raymond niles points to enron  s investments in its dabhol indian power plant  its south american investments  and its remaining telecoms assets  most importantly  he says  they may include several of enron  s other off  balance  sheet vehicles 
 frankly  we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them   mr niles says  other us energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival  el paso said it was facing  a lot of questions on its accounting practices

enron bonds fall as company taps   bln credit line  update  
 adds egan  jones lowering credit rating in  th paragraph  
houston  oct    bloomberg    enron corp  bonds and shares
fell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond
rating wouldn  t be lowered and tapped a   billion credit line
because it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets 
enron  s stock has fallen  percent in the past  days after
investors questioned the company  s transactions with affiliated
companies run by its former chief financial officer  the stock
fell  cents to     in early afternoon trading today 
  people are questioning the credibility of management   
said john cassady  who helps manage   billion of fixed income
assets at fifth third bancorp    it looks like the guy who was
supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was
running partnerships for the benefit of himself   
enron is shut out of commercial paper markets  where short 
term loans carry lower rates than banks offer  the company will
use its credit line to pay off     billion in commercial paper it
has outstanding  enron spokesman mark palmer said 
the company  s     percent bonds which mature in 
declined     points to a bid of  cents on the dollar and an
offer of  cents  at that price  the bonds  which carry a rating
of   bbb     yield    percent 
enron  s shares have dropped as investors grew concerned that
the company  s credit rating will be cut after     billion in
third  quarter losses from failed investments  enron needs good
credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding
collateral and to settle transactions 
dilution concerns
though enron  s bonds have investment  grade ratings  their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings  according to bloomberg data  companies
with   bb   ratings pay on average    percent to borrow for
seven years 
a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock  diluting the value
of enron investors  stock 
partnerships called whitewing  marlin and yosemite own enron
assets they bought with borrowed money  enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books  the
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets 
if enron loses investment  grade rating  the borrowed money
comes due earlier  leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets  enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt 
one way would be issuing common shares in exchange for enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships  that would
thin out the holding of every other investor 
of the two main bond rating companies  moody  s investors
service has the company on watch for possible downgrade  and
standard  poor  s lowered enron  s long  term credit outlook to
negative  egan  jones rating co  today lowered its rating on
enron  s debt to bb   one notch below investment grade  from bbb  
other liabilities
enron  s liabilities associated with the partnerships amounts
to at least     billion  the company has said 
enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on
wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company   million in direct
losses  enron also bought back  million shares from the
partnership  reducing shareholder equity by     billion
