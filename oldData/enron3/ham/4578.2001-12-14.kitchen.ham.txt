Subject data room binders complete
came up to the  th floor to see you a little after    today  but it was very quite on   sorry that i missed you  i had earlier delivered to mary cook  binders of operational information for ea  brought my copy by just to show you what we had put together  mary is planning to e  mail you the index list from the binders  the binders are well  organized  color  coded and filled with information that appropriately addresses the controls and operational reporting that are used in managing the gas and power business 
i will take my copy home with me over the weekend so that i can address any questions that may come up  we expect to substitute a more updated version of our cash collections process flow on monday  assuming that leslie reeves has returned from jury duty  she apparently has the  prettier  version of the process flow  but has been tied up fullfilling her civic duty   sally
