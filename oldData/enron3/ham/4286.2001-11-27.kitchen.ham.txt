enron corp   struggling to save its two  week  old deal to be acquired by dynegy inc   was in advanced discussions with dynegy to cut the price of the all  stock transaction by more than   to about   billion  according to people familiar with the matter 
beleaguered enron also was in continuing negotiations to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings in order to stem a growing liquidity crisis  these people said  enron has total debt of about   billion  increasingly  analysts are worried that the giant energy  trading concern  s relatively few hard assets are so encumbered by debt that they can  t be used to support further borrowing 
enron stock slid to its lowest level in over a decade at  p  m  yesterday on the new york stock exchange  falling  cents to     a share  over the past few months  about   billion of enron  s stock value has evaporated  a process that has accelerated since mid  october when the company announced a quarterly loss and a subsequent reduction in its equity base  since then  revelations that company executives profited from partnerships used to move assets on and off enron  s books have spooked investors and triggered a securities and exchange commission investigation  recently  the company has twice restated earnings for past periods amid indications that its vaunted energy trading business is showing some signs of stress 
the move to renegotiate the acquisition agreement  and particularly to slash the number of dynegy shares that enron holders would receive  only two weeks after the pact  s signing is virtually unheard of in corporate transactions  while terms are sometimes altered due to unanticipated developments  that typically doesn  t happen until a transaction is nearly completed 
enron had hoped to finalize arrangements and make an announcement yesterday that would calm its anxious investors  but the situation remained fluid throughout the day  as of yesterday evening  the revised deal still hadn  t been formalized 
the deal is critical for enron  in recent weeks  credit  rating agencies have indicated they will refrain from further cuts to enron  s credit rating so long as a dynegy purchase appears probable  but if that deal collapses  downgrades could occur that would put enron below investment grade and in violation of credit agreements with counterparties  this in turn could deal a savage blow to enron  s commodity  trading business that is its lifeblood 
negotiators for the two companies returned to their home bases of houston yesterday after spending much of the holiday weekend meeting in suburban new york where they tried to agree on new provisions to the deal  which was announced nov    both dynegy and enron declined to comment on the discussions 
one apparent sticking point in the talks was arriving at a new stock  exchange ratio  under the current acquisition agreement  dynegy would exchange    share for each enron share tendered  based on yesterday  s new york stock exchange closing price of     for dynegy shares  down      enron holders stand to receive     a share for their stock  or a total of about   billion 
people close to the discussions said the new ratio is expected to be less than    share of dynegy stock for every share of enron stock  which would value enron at less than   a share  or about   billion 
another contentious issue concerns the amount of additional capital enron needs to shore up its finances  a week ago  the company disclosed it may have to post hundreds of millions of dollars or more to honor collateral calls before the end of the year  the problem for potential lenders is finding good assets to back these continued infusions of capital sought by enron 
as part of the original merger agreement  dynegy already has injected     billion into enron  receiving in exchange preferred stock in its northern natural gas co  pipeline system that runs from the upper midwest to texas  under the agreement  if the acquisition falls apart  dynegy  will have the right to acquire   of the equity in the northern natural gas subsidiary   thus giving it  the full value of its investment  
but that arrangement is raising questions on wall street about whether creditors are throwing good money after bad  northern natural gas already is heavily encumbered with debts  in addition to   million in unsecured public debt and     billion put in by dynegy and co  investor chevrontexaco inc   a bank consortium led by j  p  morgan chase  co  recently put in an additional   million in cash backed by northern  s assets  the bank consortium also provided   million to enron  against which assets of enron  s transwestern pipeline co  unit were pledged  this system  a network between texas and california  is the only other domestic gas  transportation system fully owned by enron 
that brings total indebtedness to nearly   billion for two enron pipeline systems that only generated transportation revenue of   million and   million  respectively  in the third quarter  enron  s entire natural  gas pipeline business  which includes two other partially owned systems  produced pretax earnings of   million for the third quarter  flat with the year  earlier period  some observers said that if the enron deal to be acquired by dynegy falls apart  this could set the stage for a fight among the different classes of creditors for a priority claim on the pipeline assets

in the  s  as the stock market climbed year after year  many corporations and their employees entered into a marriage of convenience  the company would dole out its own shares as compensation and benefits  employees would have a steadily appreciating asset that encouraged loyalty and created an incentive to work hard for the company  s success 
they  re still doing it  gillette co   for example   believes it is important that employee interests be aligned with company interests   says spokesman stephen k  brayton  echoing the explanations of dozens of other companies that use their own stock for executive pay  incentive bonuses  or contributions to   k  retirement  savings accounts 
but as share prices have fallen over the past year and a half  it has become clear that not all stock handouts are created equal  millions of rank  and  file workers at hundreds of companies have found themselves shackled to big chunks of company stock  while executives are able to exercise wide latitude in what they do with theirs  because of the law capping tax  deductible executive compensation at   million a year  many companies top off their executive pay packages with stock options  as well as bonuses and other incentives that are typically paid in stock  much of it unencumbered 
based on filings with the securities and exchange commission  hundreds of companies use their own stock in lieu of cash as their matching contributions to employees  retirement  savings accounts  and the majority of those restrict the ability of employees to sell the shares and move the proceeds into mutual funds and other alternatives offered through their   k  s  benefits consultants hewitt associates found in a recent study that nearly half of  firms offering company stock in their   k  plans only contribute their own shares to employee accounts  and that   of those companies restrict sales of the stock 
gillette doesn  t let employees switch out of its stock contributions to their   k  s until age   according to government filings  at coca  cola co   it  s age   procter  gamble co   qwest communications international inc  and troubled enron corp    now facing lawsuits over employees    k  losses   are among the many others that impose similar restrictions  so far this year  gillette employees have had to watch the company  contribution portion of their retirement savings shrink by millions of dollars as the share price has fallen    employees at coca  cola have endured a share  price decline this year of    procter the value of mr  anschutz  s shares covered in the agreement would have plunged to   million from   million   those shares amounted to about     of mr  anschutz  s total holding of  million shares  or   of qwest  s shares outstanding  both directly and through a company he controls  
a forward  sale agreement wasn  t available to joseph daugherty  he has been stringing and repairing telephone cable for  years  first for bell south corp  and then in the salt lake city area for u s west  which was acquired by qwest last year 
a few months ago  he was looking forward to early retirement next summer  but now  he says  he  ll have to keep working  the     in assets he had in his   k  in early may has shrunk to roughly      part of that loss is attributable to the retirement plan  s rules  which don  t allow most workers to shift out of company  contributed qwest shares until age   mr  daugherty  who concedes he  s a risk  taker  blames himself for the rest  he voluntarily sank the remainder of his   k  savings into qwest stock 
qwest won  t comment on the finances of either mr  daugherty or mr  anschutz  but steve hammack  a qwest spokesman  says u s west established the policy of contributing company stock  he notes that starting jan      the company began allowing managers to diversify company stock contributions they receive this year into other investments available through the plan  the restrictions on union members  he says  are covered by the company  s collective bargaining agreement 
 the fact is   mr  hammack responds in an email   the majority of companies in the u  s  that match employee contributions do so in their own company stock  a good number also restrict employees from diversifying out of the company match  
erisa  the federal law governing pension plans  provides employees with little legal traction to complain about their forced   k  holdings  employer contributions to retirement  savings plans aren  t generally subject to fiduciary rules   as for employee contributions  employers are supposed to choose  prudent  investment options  
retirement  savings plans are exempt from erisa diversification rules  too  these rules make it illegal for a company  s pension plan to invest more than   of its assets in the company  s own securities  but savings plans such as   k  s can generally invest as much as   of the assets in company stock with impunity  currently  roughly one  third to one  half of retirement  plan assets at large companies are invested in company stock  that suits employers  which would just as soon contribute stock as draw down precious cash  and in the past  they have lobbied successfully to defeat efforts to impose diversification rules on   k  s 
that confounds people such as mr  triska  the technician at enron  s portland general electric unit   anyone will tell you that you need to diversify to reduce risk   he says 
diversification has spared mr  triska some of the pain experienced by co  workers who bet big on enron in their retirement savings  since sept    while the enron shares in his   k  have plunged    his shares in weitz partners value fund have declined only      and his shares in fidelity growth company and janus global life sciences funds have risen     and      respectively 
enron executives are subject to the same restrictions on enron  s stock contributions to their   k  s as other employees  no sales of company  contributed stock until age   but company filings with the sec show that  key management and highly compensated employees  also participate in separate retirement  savings plans that don  t require them to hold enron stock at all  executives can pile as much as   of their salaries and   of their bonuses annually into these accounts  allocating the money among a variety of investments 
further  sec filings show that so far this year  many enron executives were steady sellers of company stock they had accumulated beyond the ambit of their   k  s  former enron broadband services chief executive kenneth rice  for example  sold enron shares valued at     million during the period  and former ceo jeffrey skilling sold     million of enron stock 
 we believe it  s important for employees to have a stake in the company   says karen denne  a spokeswoman for enron   it  s also important that we align employee and company performance

enron talking with dynegy as they work to rescue deal

c   new york times company
the enron corporation and its would  be rescuer  dynegy inc   are renegotiating the terms of their deal  originally valued at   billion  executives close to the discussions said yesterday 
there were several issues still on the table last night  and the situation was very fluid  the executives said  but they said that the companies hoped to announce  perhaps as early as today  a series of changes  a lower price for the takeover  a cash infusion of   million  an agreement by some banks to extend the repayment dates of enron debt until after the deal closes  and possibly an agreement making clear that the merger would not be derailed by litigation over enron  s devastated employee  retirement plan 
the sides were also negotiating ways to tighten clauses in the merger agreement so that dynegy would not be able to use information from enron  s recent filing with the securities and exchange commission as a reason for backing out of the deal 
both companies declined to comment on whether renegotiations were taking place 
but according to executives close to the talks  the new terms would lower the ratio of dynegy stock to be exchanged to roughly    share for each share of enron  the original deal  announced nov    called for each enron share to be exchanged for    share of dynegy  but enron  s shares have been plunging steadily  and yesterday the current offer was valued at  percent over enron  s closing price 
the companies hope that by releasing some good news  they can stem the slide in the price of enron  s stock and traded debt  enron shares  which have been plunging since mid  october when the company began to disclose a series of losses and accounting errors  closed yesterday at      down    percent  or  cents  shares of dynegy closed at     yesterday  down    percent  or     
more important  the executives close to the talks said  the companies hope to restore confidence in enron  s energy  trading operation  which showed signs of deterioration yesterday  in recent years  enron has traded more natural gas and electricity than its two biggest competitors combined  and its trading floor is viewed as its most valuable franchise  accounting for most of the company  s profit 
dynegy  s biggest worry  according to the executives  is that this core business is deteriorating  the company fears that if other energy traders further curtail their business with enron   either on their own or in response to another cut in enron  s credit rating   then much of the value of the company could be wiped out  they said 
the urgency of the situation has been made clear by the way in which enron is being treated in the energy  trading markets  some analysts and executives at rival energy companies say  though some large traders are still doing business with enron  many other traders have curtailed their dealings with the company for fear they may not get paid if enron collapses and files for bankruptcy protection 
in addition  some of the energy trading enron is doing is costing it more money because of credit concerns  for example  analysts and energy executives say  enron is in some cases being forced to pay  cents to  cents more per million british thermal units of natural gas  that means instead of paying perhaps     per million b  t  u   s in some trades  it may be paying     
jeff dietert  an analyst with simmons  company in houston  said the price discrepancies on some trades were also showing up on enrononline  the internet platform that accounts for much of the company  s trading with other parties 
  we  re seeing enron  s prices    mr  dietert said    be about a nickel higher on enrononline versus some of the competing internet  based exchanges    if these credit premiums should continue  it could erode enron  s trading profits and worsen its already tenuous liquidity situation 
an enron spokeswoman  karen denne  said trading volumes were   below average    yesterday  but she declined to be more specific  she did say the company was in discussions about a new equity infusion of   million to   billion 
according to executives close to the talks  details were still being worked out on the cash infusion  which would come from citigroup and j  p  morgan chase  dynegy may also add cash to the deal while reaffirming the company  s commitment to the merger 
executives at rival trading companies said dynegy needed to do something to bolster confidence in enron  s trading operations 
  in places  enron is paying up to  or  or  cents more for next  day gas    said an executive at one large energy trader    some producers out there don  t want to sell additional discretionary gas to enron  so they  re having to pay up   
the executive also said most energy traders expected that dynegy would obtain a much lower merger price because enron had little or no room to fight a renegotiation 
  if enron hasn  t lined something else up  their other choice is bankruptcy    he said    you can guess what shareholder value is going to look like if that  s the case

top companies issuing debt at a fast pace

in the weeks since the attack on the world trade center  blue  chip corporations have issued a torrent of debt 
ford  general electric  i  b  m   kraft  at  t  general motors and other companies have doubled and even trebled their initial plans for bond offerings as investors  disenchanted with the stock market  have all but begged to buy their debt  in all  companies have issued    percent more debt in the last  weeks than they did in the period a year earlier 
the companies are taking advantage of the chance to raise cash at bargain basement prices  thanks to low interest rates  and to retire more expensive debt 
but they may also have little  discussed concerns that money will be scarce in the future  particularly if the economic downturn persists and the recovery is less vigorous than economists now hope  bank lending is at a   year low  according to the conference board  and buyers are hard to find for commercial paper  the short  term  cheap debt that corporate purebreds rely on  standard it was able to raise     billion and is said to be thinking about trying to raise   billion more 
kraft foods  part of the philip morris companies  had planned to issue   billion worth of bonds  instead  it offered   billion 
at  t raised     billion  twice as much as it originally planned  at  t  s and ford  s issues rank as the second  and third  largest ever 
all told   corporations have issued   billion of debt since sept    compared with  companies that raised   billion in the period last year  according to thomson financial  first call 
  when you look at other asset classes  the corporate bond market offers some of the better values    said bob lobue  head of the investment  grade fixed  income syndicate at j  p  morgan  which has underwritten roughly half the issues that have come to market since sept      there  s still a lack of confidence in stock valuations based on the weakness we  re seeing in earnings   
issuers and their underwriters most often cite the low interest rates on treasury bills as the reason for the surge in corporate debt  corporate bonds are often priced in relation to united states government debt  and thanks to a cascade of interest rate cuts by the federal reserve this year  well  heeled companies can borrow at extremely attractive rates 
international business machines  for instance  recently sold     billion worth of five  year notes with the lowest coupon it has ever issued     percent 
others  though  read the stampede of premier companies to issue debt as a sign that credit is getting tight  investment  grade companies typically juggle a smorgasbord of debt   short  intermediate and long term   but they are definitely skewing the mixture toward the long end these days  no doubt  that is because debt is cheap   but it also suggests that they may foresee a time when money will be more scarce and are accumulating the war chests mr  cunningham referred to 
it was not so long ago  after all  that companies experienced a credit shortage    a credit crunch was brewing last year    mr  cunningham said    until the fed stepped in and started aggressively lowering interest rates  which averted it   
but a cash problem persists in some ways despite the federal reserve  s series of interest rate cuts    we are in a cash crisis like none we have experienced in recent memory    said james padilla  a ford executive  in a recent memorandum to his staff 
many companies with less  than  pristine credit ratings have trouble raising money and may be having more because of the stampede by blue  chip companies 
  when companies like ford or general electric come into the market  they squeeze a lot of other  somewhat riskier credits out    said gail d  fosler  the chief economist at the conference board 
jack ablin  chief investment officer at the harris trust and savings bank  said that the economic recovery depended on companies  being able to get credit 
  my primary concern is the lack of available credit across the spectrum    he said    we are forecasting an economic recovery in the middle of next year  but the one thing that could go wrong with that forecast is if the availability of credit stays where it is or gets worse   
another concern is that debt is piling up with negative consequences    the fed is trying to prevent the bubble from bursting by keeping the forces of credit exuberance alive    barton m  biggs  chief global strategist at morgan stanley  wrote to investors earlier this month    the trouble is  although it may work in the short run  in the long run the debt burden will be bigger and the adjustment process more painful   
the automakers  for example  are using the money they have raised in part to support the customer incentive programs that offer zero  interest financing  they are paying as much as    percent  in other words  to lend money to car buyers for nothing 
some of the new debt is being used to retire commercial paper  but companies are taking on more than they need to accomplish that goal 
the longer  term money they are borrowing is more expensive than the commercial paper  even if it is cheaper than it has been in a long time  the spread   the difference in interest rates between treasuries and corporate bonds   has generally widened since sept    although not across the board 
  there is a cost factor involved  but we try to minimize that    said david moore  manager of fixed  income investor relations at ford credit  which accounted for the bulk of the     billion that ford borrowed last month    we  re mindful of our liquidity  and want to make sure we ensure it   
like many of the companies issuing debt  ford is curbing its dependence on the commercial paper market  for the year through oct    ford had cut the amount of paper it had outstanding by almost  percent  to   billion    that puts us in a very good position  given our rating    said mr  moore  who was one of the few executives willing to discuss his company  s strategy 
ford  like a host of other companies  has had its credit ratings cut  many buyers of commercial paper  like money market funds  lend to only the highest  rated companies  so far this year  standard  poor  s has knocked  companies out of the top ratings for commercial paper  compared with  last year 
the total amount of outstanding commercial paper has fallen  percent this year  according to diane vazza  head of global financial investment research at standard  poor  s  thanks to that downgrading and to great caution among investors    we  ve seen some issuers driven out of the market    ms  vazza said 
according to several credit analysts  daimlerchrysler was scheduled to roll over   billion of commercial paper in june but decided to take the offering to europe  where investors are less particular about ratings quality 
similarly  enron careered into its crisis when it was forced to redeem commercial paper as its credit ratings fell 
the decline in at  t  s commercial paper ratings was one reason for its big issue last week 
but underwriters of corporate debt insist that the decline in the commercial paper market has more to do with companies  ability to borrow for the long term cheaply than with their inability to issue short  term debt    short  term financing does come with a maturity risk in that you constantly have to roll it over in order to maintain liquidity    said mr  lobue of j  p  morgan 
the underwriters concede  however  that lending by banks has all but dried up  falling to its lowest level in three decades  bank lending has been curtailed at the behest of federal regulators like the federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of the comptroller of the currency at the treasury department  putting them seemingly at cross  purposes with the fed 
the chief executive of echostar  charles w  ergen  had to put up     billion of his own money to complete the purchase of the hughes electronic corporation  the bankers at ubs warburg  echostar  s adviser on the deal  had offered to provide the financing  but only with a proviso that would have let the bank back out of the deal under certain conditions 
although the company later got financing from credit suisse first boston and deutsche bank  many other bankers have privately applauded ubs warburg  s caution

shunned by investors and deserted by many former customers  enron corp  is searching this week for up to   billion in cash from lenders to sustain its once dominant energy  trading business 
enron stock fell yesterday to new low of     a share  down  cents  continuing the latest plunge that began last week when the houston company disclosed still more damaging detail about its financial condition 
a year ago  enron stock traded for more than   a share  based on its leading position then as a trader of power  natural gas  various industrial and telecommunications products and financial contracts linked to these commodities 
dynegy inc   enron  s houston rival  said yesterday it was not moving away from its   billion cash and debt offer to buy enron  enron declined to comment on its financial problems 
but enron  s stock has dropped more than  percent since the dynegy deal was announced nov    investors believe that dynegy will renegotiate the deal at a cheaper price or even try to abandon it  said brian youngberg  a financial analyst with edward d  jones  co  in st  louis 
 the  dynegy  deal values enron at more than   a share  for a company that  s trading at    that doesn  t make much sense   said youngberg  who last week recommended that customers sell enron shares 
as part of the dynegy deal  enron received     billion in cash  secured by stock in one of its pipelines  but without another large infusion of cash  the company faces what youngberg called a  death spiral  
along with investors  many energy buyers and traders have lost confidence in enron  s ability to make good on the long  term energy contracts it specializes in  youngberg said  enron  s most important operations involve contracts to deliver natural gas  electric power and other energy products to industries and utilities in the future  it also sells financial instruments designed to protect customers against sharp swings in energy prices 
these deals are the one part of enron that dynegy wants 
 their core business has dropped off sharply   said andrew meade  an analyst with commerzbank securities in new york  enron remains a sizable player in the huge daily trading of energy products  but is being frozen out of long  term markets and relegated to less profitable short  term trades  said meade 
the lengthy span of enron  s crisis  which began a month ago when it reported a     billion reduction in shareholder equity  has given companies time to close out contracts with enron or limit their potential losses if enron were to fail  said louis b  gagliardi  an analyst with john s  herold inc  in connecticut 
 if enron went to a chapter  bankruptcy  or failed  it would unsettle the market slightly  but it wouldn  t catch people by surprise  so there  s not much danger of a crisis on the natural gas or power side  of energy trading  gagliardi said  other market participants cautioned that the extent of enron  s obligations to trading partners is not known to outsiders  making the impact of an enron failure hard to assess 
dynegy and its partner  chevrontexaco corp   could pump billions of dollars into enron  s operations if the purchase went through  but under the best of circumstances  regulatory review of the deal will drag on for another six months  investors and traders are increasingly doubtful that enron can hang around that long by itself   that just adds to the uncertainty about the stock   gagliardi said 
dynegy  s offer for enron caused a brief rally in enron  s stock price and outlook 
but that flurry of optimism was halted by a new financial report last week to the securities and exchange commission detailing even more serious debt obligations than the company had previously acknowledged 
enron was able to negotiate a three  week extension on a   million note that was coming due this week and finished arrangements on a   million line of credit  part of a   billion infusion it had previously announced 
however  the   million obligation  disclosed in the sec filing  was a very pointed alert to investors about enron  s growing cash needs  meade said 
and the new details of enron  s plight in last week  s filing further damaged the credibility of the company  s financial reporting  meade said 
 i don  t think they have fully restated their earnings  there is probably more to come  meade said  
enron  s board has turned to an outside committee to assess the company  s financial condition  after acknowledging last month that enron had overstated earnings by   million over the past four years 
the restatement was caused primarily by accounting decisions that concealed losses in a series of limited partnerships that enron had helped create to buy various energy  water supply and internet network properties it wanted to dispose of  the company said 
on nov    enron  s new chief financial officer  jeff mcmahon  briefed analysts on a series of steps the company would take to raise cash  including the current quest for   million to   billion in loans  enron  its executives said  will reorganize the company around its business that generated the strongest cash flow   energy trades  gas pipeline and coal operations  other assets  worth   billion in book value  would be put up for sale  in an orderly fashion  
then came the new disclosures last week  reinforcing analysts  concerns that the depths of enron  s liabilities have not yet been plumbed 
 the issues that brought enron to this point are unresolved  it  s a balance sheet that doesn  t stand still and continues to deteriorate   gagliardi said

enron  dynegy deal back on table
energy traders said to be renegotiating premium for shares
by laura goldberg
copyright  houston chronicle
dynegy and enron corp  could announce new terms for dynegy  s deal to buy enron as soon as today  according to sources familiar with talks between the two companies 
the two houston  based energy traders  the sources said  spent the weekend and monday discussing  among other issues  a lower exchange rate for dynegy  s stock deal to buy enron 
as of monday evening  no exchange rate had been agreed to and discussions were continuing  the sources said  cautioning that the situation was fluid 
also monday 
 enron and dynegy  the sources said  were working to finalize terms for an equity infusion into enron of around   million that  s expected to come from j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup  another equity infusion from other parties could come later  the sources said 
 enron  dynegy and a group of banks were negotiating terms for a so  called  override  agreement that would extend  until after the merger closed  maturity dates for certain debt enron is due to repay or that could come due before  the sources said  it was unclear how much of approximately the   billion in obligations enron could have coming due in the next  months that would be covered by that restructuring 
 it was expected that enron would start layoffs sometime this week 
karen denne  an enron spokeswoman  said her only comment was that any action the company would take concerning job cuts would be communicated first to employees 
 california attorney general bill lockyer  not known for harboring a favorable attitude toward enron or other texas energy companies  has started reviewing the planned merger  looking for potential antitrust problems  his office said  dynegy has power plants there  while enron sells power and natural gas into the state 
 shares in both companies fell  with enron closing down  cents at      while shares in dynegy ended the day down     at     
the talks between enron and dynegy come amid wall street expectations that dynegy will renegotiate the merger terms or back out of the deal completely  the sources said that at the moment  the companies aren  t discussing canceling the deal 
on nov    the day dynegy announced it would acquire its troubled rival  shares in enron closed at      while shares in dynegy closed at     
the merger agreement calls for enron shareholders to get    share of dynegy per enron share  based on the nov   closing prices  dynegy would be paying     a share for enron 
but since  enron  s share prices have dropped significantly amid increasing concerns about its ability to maintain its core trading business and troubling new disclosures about its financial shape 
based on monday  s closing prices  dynegy would be paying more       a share   for enron  which is worth considerably less based on market capitalization than when the deal was announced 
last week  one stock analyst said he thought a ratio of no more than    share of dynegy per enron share might be more realistic 
dynegy spokesman john sousa said monday that dynegy was continuing its  due diligence  review of enron  s books and  looking at everything very closely  
unless the merger with dynegy goes through  enron could be forced into bankruptcy protection 
enron  s core trading business has eroded  the securities and exchange commission is investigating its finances and it faces a pile of debt as well as an increasing number of shareholder and employee lawsuits 
enron and dynegy hoped the merger deal  which included an immediate infusion of     billion of equity into enron  would stabilize enron 
but new financial disclosures have had the opposite effect 
for example  on nov    enron revealed   million in debt would come due sooner than expected because of a credit  rating downgrade 
the news came as a surprise even to dynegy 
dynegy has escape hatches in its merger agreement  including a  material adverse change  clause that applies generally to enron  s financial state 
also  if the amount of legal and shareholder claims enron must pay out is greater than     billion  the deal can be called off 
sousa described the escape clauses as  broad provisions  to ensure dynegy is adequately protected

sizable staff of  lawyers in merger limbo
by mary flood
copyright  houston chronicle
whether troubled enron corp  merges  falls or stays the course  it is likely to deeply affect one of houston  s largest law offices  the one within the embattled company 
 we  ve always regarded them as one of the big law firms in houston   said howard ayers  managing partner of andrews  kurth  one of the city  s largest firms with about  lawyers in houston alone 
enron has about  lawyers worldwide  company spokesman vance meyer said  that  s a large legal stable even for a company with more than    employees  with about  lawyers in houston  if it were a private firm it would have been the city  s sixth  largest  according to the chronicle  survey released in may 
energy trader enron  s internal law office has burgeoned along with the huge trading firm  now set to merge with a smaller but stronger local competitor  dynegy  as enron  s stock plummeted further  dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave enron to face a possible bankruptcy 
whatever the company  s fate  there are rough waters ahead for enron lawyers 
although most lawyers interviewed said they hope everybody remains employed and that it is premature to discuss the fate of enron  s legal staff  speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that enron will hold on tightly to its talent 
 my guess is they  ll need their lawyers while they get things in a more steady state  there  s a lot of legal work to go through   said joel swanson  a senior partner at baker  botts  a houston law firm with about  lawyers here 
not only does enron have a large cadre of lawyers inside its company  but it also has hired just about every large firm in houston over the last few years  several of the biggest houston firms are working on the merger for either enron or dynegy  and others are standing by wondering which outside firms will get the biggest pieces of legal work when the new company is created 
enron  s legal department has siphoned talent from houston  s top law firms over the years  heads of law firms said they have seen plenty of promising lawyers lured away by enron  s competitive pay combined with stock options  which were a lucrative draw until recently  as shares have lost  percent of their value 
 enron has one of the premier legal departments in the country   said jeff love  managing partner of locke liddell  sapp  a houston  based firm with about  of its lawyers here 
enron has hired a lot of what are called  laterals   or lawyers who have had a couple years training  often at a big firm 
although jobs in corporate counsel offices are generally considered easier than big  firm life  that  s not the reputation of enron  s legal eagles 
as with the company itself  the general counsel  s office has been known as innovative and hard driving 
 i don  t think anybody lateraled into enron with the expectation of an ordinary life   ayers said 
in the houston market  where big  firm first  year lawyers start at around     a year  the advantages of going to an expanding company like enron were the stock options and the opportunity to grow with the company 
if heavily anticipated layoffs occur at enron  top houston lawyers expect casualties to land on their feet  looming recessions are not always bad for job  hunting lawyers  bankruptcy  litigation and mergers all can boom in rough times 
several houston  based law firms said they have recruited a slightly larger starting class of lawyers for   meaning they don  t expect to scale back their business in the immediate future 
should the merger succeed  enron  s  lawyers will join dynegy  s  
 the question of how you integrate the two staffs  as with a lot of things associated with the merger  won  t be worked out for some time   dynegy spokesman steve stengel said

bin laden threat against pipelines taken seriously
ashcroft  unconfirmed warning linked to leader  s death  capture
by michael davis
copyright  houston chronicle
the fbi confirmed monday that it has warned the energy industry that osama bin laden may have ordered strikes against u  s  natural gas facilities if he is caught or killed 
the agency issued the warning last week  attorney general john ashcroft said at a news conference monday  it had uncorroborated information that bin laden may have approved plans for such attacks  ashcroft added 
the fbi warning said  such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin laden or taliban leader mullah omar are either captured or killed  
the warning hit home in houston because while the warning did not single out a target  it referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure  such as pipelines  houston is the hub of this industry and is at the center of a dense web of gas pipelines 
the warning was considered similar to the one issued earlier about potential attacks against west coast bridges 
ashcroft said the government is in regular communication with companies that own the nation  s energy infrastructure  such as refineries  natural gas pipelines and nuclear plants 
federal law enforcement officials received the uncorroborated report of undetermined reliability about a potential attack against natural gas supplies about  days ago  ashcroft said 
since the terrorist attacks on sept    all energy companies have established more stringent security measures  pipelines  however  are considered especially vulnerable since they are accessible above ground in remote areas with typically little more than a padlock and a metal fence to keep out someone wanting to damage the line 
reliant energy entex  the natural gas distribution company that serves the houston area  was notified about the warning but has not added any new security measures as a result  company spokeswoman alicia dixon said 
 we  ve been on a heightened state of alert since sept   so nothing is different today than it was yesterday   dixon said   we have very strong security in place already because of the nature of our business  we have to be prepared to deal with a variety of emergencies  
dixon said the company recieved word of the warning from the american gas association  the american petroleum institute also passed the warning on to energy companies  api spokesman juan palomo said 
enron notified its employees of the warning and also has been on heightened state of alert since sept    company spokeswoman gina taylor said 
 we take all threats seriously   taylor said 
enron monitors its pipelines and related facilities such as compression stations using planes  cars and on foot  she said  the company has not added staff to beef up its security as a result of the warning  she said 
 we routinely patrol the right of way   she said 
there are thousands of miles of natural gas pipelines running throughout the nation  thirty interstate gas pipelines carry  percent of the natural gas transported  according to the interstate natural gas association of america 
detailed information about locations of pipelines and other energy infrastructure has been taken off some corporate and government internet sites  access to facilities has been tightened as well  officials said 
federal regulators have offered help to pay for the added protection by speeding rate hike requests for beefed  up security 
if a pipeline were attacked with an explosive  for example  the operator could shut off the flow of natural gas  oil or refined products from either side of the break

current recession differs from others
by jim barlow
copyright  houston chronicle
so it  s official  the united states is in a recession 
that was the word monday from the national bureau of economic research  a recession  by the by  comes about after six months of declining economic activity  in this case  the bureau said  the recession started last march  so we  re already through almost nine months of slowdown 
but there  s something very different about this recession  different from all the others we  ve experienced in the past four or five decades  we were not led into it by a huge oversupply of all kinds of real estate and a collapse in those prices 
the current recession was sparked by a high  tech collapse  led by a glut of technology products 
that doesn  t mean real estate will sail through untouched this recession  there are places that will be hurting  san francisco comes to mind  it is a high  tech center  and there was a lot of building to accommodate that industry 
there is also one real estate sector in trouble   the hotel industry  it had already been hurt by a downturn in business travel  the sept   terrorist attacks sent it  and air travel  reeling 
recall see  through buildings 
but there  s nothing like we saw back in the mid   s  remember when houston enriched the nation  s vocabulary by coming up with the term see  through buildings  those were the many skyscrapers in houston that had been built but never finished inside  so you could look right through them because there were no interior walls 
indeed  if real estate is a bright spot in this recession  real estate in houston is a great shining light 
houston  s office building market is tight  the downtown office market has an    percent vacancy rate  and prime class a space prized by major corporations is effectively full  there should be some easing of that rate  enron corp   with its well  publicized freefall  has almost completed a new headquarters  even more space will be coming onto the market when the   story calpine center office tower is completed at  texas ave  in  
century development has announced it is working on a   story office tower downtown  crescent real estate equities is building a tower on the other side of main street  all this  plus cutbacks at continental airlines and the pending sale of compaq computer corp  to hewlett  packard co   will doubtless hurt the office market  but no one is predicting disaster 
the houston apartment market may be the nation  s healthiest  with    percent of houston  s apartments occupied in the third quarter of this year  that figure is almost a full percentage point higher than the year before  prices for apartments are up  as are rents 
sales of used homes in october were the highest ever  with the median price up    percent  new  home sales are setting records 
developers are optimists
so how did we escape the usual  credit lenders 
real estate developing is full of optimists  ask any developer   even in the midst of a bust   and he  ll tell you  it won  t affect his building  which somehow is nicer  sexier or even more depression  proof than the next guy  s  give a developer money  and he will build 
lenders have been as tight as the bark on trees  that has forced developers to pre  lease buildings and seek partners with equity   primarily pension funds   before the banks would loan them money for new projects 
several things happen to the real estate business during a recession  prices fall or stabilize   and in this particular recession the bet is probably on stabilization  the banks and others that loan that money generally tighten credit standards  cutting off weaker real estate players  and the federal reserve board helps out the economy by lowering rates  which aids bargain hunters with deep pockets 
in any recession  even one that is as benign to real estate as this one  some properties won  t survive the economic downturn and owners will have to sell or file for bankruptcy 
with the current low interest rates  companies with good credit will move in and buy those properties  remember the so  called vulture funds of the  s 
how soon this process starts will determine the length of this recession  because real estate is in good shape this time  the process is not as important as it was in the  s  still  if investors promptly snap up distressed properties  that will increase the odds that this recession will be a short one

 updates to add instinet trading  comment by tice  
houston  nov    bloomberg    enron corp  shares rose as
much as    percent on instinet amid optimism dynegy inc  will
proceed with its proposed acquisition of the rival u  s  energy
trader after renegotiating the terms of its offer 
shares of the energy trader plunged  percent last week on
concern the merger would unravel after enron said it had more debt
and less cash than previously announced  threatening its ability
to operate until dynegy completes the purchase 
executives of the two companies discussed possible changes in
the terms over the weekend  people familiar with the matter said
yesterday  dynegy is now talking about paying less than   
shares for each of enron  s  valuing the company  s equity at about
  billion  or less than   per share  the wall street journal
reported  citing people close to the discussions 
  the choices are fairly stark  renegotiate the deal or file
for chapter     said john olson  an analyst with sanders morris
harris  a houston  based financial services company 
enron shares rose as much as  cents to     on instinet 
the original dynegy bid valued enron at     a share in dynegy
stock  the discount reflects skepticism among investors the
acquisition will be completed under the original terms 
bond investors were less optimistic  the company  s   
percent bonds that mature in  declined to  cents on the
dollar from  cents on the dollar yesterday  traders said  at
that price  the bonds yield    percent 
  the concern is that the dynegy deal breaks down    said
paul tice  co  head of u  s  high  grade credit research who covers
the energy market for deutsche bank  last week  s securities and
exchange commission filing   had a lot of negative surprises   
investors have become concerned because enron hasn  t been
able to complete a proposal to raise   billion through a private
equity sale and moody  s investors service is weighing whether to
downgrade the company  s credit rating 
extension 
the companies may announce as early as today an extension by
some banks on the repayment of enron  s debt  a   million cash
infusion from citigroup inc  and j  p  morgan chase  co   and an
agreement that would keep the purchase intact despite lawsuits
over enron  s employee  retirement plan  the new york times said 
neither enron spokeswoman karen denne nor dynegy spokesman
john sousa would comment on whether talks on a new buyout
agreement are underway 
current terms call for an exchange ratio of    share of
dynegy stock for each enron share  given recent disclosures about
enron  s debt and the drop in the stock price  a fairer ratio would
be    share of dynegy  said ronald barone  a ubs warburg analyst
who rates dynegy a   strong buy   
  if they can renegotiate the deal to half  the original
price   that  s where you get really attractive earnings    said
gordon howald  an analyst at credit lyonnais who rates dynegy a
  buy   
enron  s debt
under current terms  the deal makes sense for dynegy only if
enron earns  cents or more  howald said  barone has reduced his
estimate of enron  s  earnings from     a share to  cents 
dynegy shares fell      or    percent  to    
yesterday 
new terms may not be necessary if enron can get the
additional   billion in financing it  s seeking  some investors
said 
  if people who  ve looked at enron are willing to put in that
kind of money  it sends a message that their core businesses  
trading  pipelines and energy management   are still sound   
said kathleen vuchetich  who helps manage     billion in assets
in the strong utilities fund     percent of which is dynegy
stock 
enron has debt payments of more than   billion due before the
end of   and has less than   billion in cash and credit lines
left  the company said in a filing last week  if its cash reserves
run too low  enron  s credit rating may be cut below investment
grade  that would trigger     billion in debt repayments for two
affiliated partnerships 
reprieve
moody  s investors service hasn  t issued a report on enron
since the company filed a   q quarterly report with the
securities and exchange commission last week  on nov    it rated
enron  s debt one notch above junk  the rating company  s analysts
didn  t return calls seeking comment 
egan  jones ratings co  lowered its rating on enron  s credit
today to   bb    from   bb    a level below investment grade 
the houston  based company also said in the filing that it had
a   million note due this week  and that it may have to reduce
fourth  quarter earnings by   million  the write  off would come
because it used stock to guarantee debt owed by an affiliated
partnership  and the value of that stock has plunged 
on wednesday  enron got a three  week reprieve from lenders on
the   million note and closed on a   million credit line 
dynegy chief executive officer chuck watson said he was
  encouraged   by the developments 
enron is negotiating to restructure its other debt  denne
said yesterday  j  p  morgan and citigroup executives met today to
line up investors willing to buy   billion in bonds convertible

many of enron  s trading partners are shunning the company

as dynegy inc  continued to scrutinize merger partner enron corp   s tangled finances  wall street traders bet that dynegy is on the verge of either calling off the enron buyout it announced three weeks ago or renegotiating a much cheaper price for its once  highflying rival 
 the market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms   said a  g  edwards analyst michael heim 
the new york times reported the companies as early as tuesday could announce a new deal  which could reduce by nearly half dynegy  s   billion takeover offer 
under terms of the original agreement between the two houston  based energy concerns  enron stockholders are to swap each of their shares for little more than a quarter  share of dynegy stock  which closed monday at      that would value enron shares at     
if investors believed the stock  for  stock deal was likely to go through  they would be willing to pay something very close to that price for enron shares   but they  re not 
as investor doubts have grown  so has the gap between the buyout price and the trading price of enron  s stock  on monday  enron  s battered shares slid to their lowest level in years  dropping  cents  or  percent  to close at     
enron  s market capitalization   the value of the company  s approximately  million shares   has plunged to     billion  in february  enron  s market cap was about   billion 
with monday  s slippage  enron shares are trading at a  percent discount to the dynegy offer  the shares of acquisition targets typically trade at a less than  percent discount to the deal price after a merger announcement 
dynegy saying little
as dynegy  s audit team continued its in  depth review of enron  s books monday  a company spokesman declined to discuss rumors swirling around the deal   the due diligence continues   said john sousa  the dynegy spokesman   we  re looking closely at enron  
asked about one analyst  s recent projection that dynegy may renegotiate the transaction  s exchange ratio and give enron holders just    dynegy shares for each enron share  rather than the agreed upon    ratio  sousa said   we don  t comment on speculation  
there is no shortage of speculation of late in the  soap opera that is enron   said commentator carol levenson of the gimme credit bond market newsletter 
levenson suggested that  there  s a game of chicken going on between enron  its bankers  its ostensible merger partner  dynegy  and the rating agencies   any of the parties  could send this company over the edge at any moment   she said  and enron  is in an increasingly weak negotiating position  
enron  s fall from grace has been astonishingly swift and painful for its stockholders  some of whom are suing the company for allegedly using misleading accounting measures to conceal the shaky state of its finances 
with monday  s drop  enron shares have tumbled  percent from the   they commanded just  months ago 
once a regional pipeline operator known as houston natural gas  enron transformed itself during the  s through an ambitious expansion plan  it acquired electric utility operations  built overseas power plants and developed an innovative energy trading operation 
partnership woes
the strategy made enron a stock market darling  but it also periodically strained the company  s liquidity  to help keep its credit ratings strong  the company created limited partnerships that allowed enron to keep billions of dollars in debt obligations off its books and out of sight of most investors 
while enron  s power trading group has experienced operating problems of late  it is the limited partnerships   some of which were managed by enron officials   that proved to be the company  s downfall 
in october  enron disclosed that it had shrunk its shareholder equity by     billion to buy back  million shares it had issued to the partnerships  the charge associated with  unwinding  the web of partnerships stunned investors by giving the company an unforeseen   million third  quarter loss  it also spurred a markdown of enron  s credit ratings to just above junk  bond status  as well as a securities and exchange commission investigation into enron  s partnership practices 
as further accounting difficulties surfaced  enron  s finances have turned increasingly shaky  and some other trading companies  fearing exposure to enron  s problems  have become reluctant do new transactions with the company 
as part of the buyout arrangement  dynegy  s  percent owner  chevron  texaco corp   has given enron     billion in upfront cash  in exchange  dynegy obtained rights that would allow it to acquire the desirable northern natural gas co  pipeline if the deal falls through 
dynegy has the right to walk away from the deal if enron suffers what  s known as a  material adverse change   but as tyson foods inc  found out this year when it unsuccessfully sought to break its agreement to buy meatpacker ibp inc  after an accounting mess at ibp  proving such a claim can be difficult

new york   enron corp  shares monday sank to a low not seen since the  stock market crash  as investors continued to mark down the chances of the energy trader  s completing its pending buyout by rival dynegy inc 
enron stock tumbled  cents  or    to     on the new york stock exchange  dynegy fell      or    to     on the big board 
the pressure on enron is mounting not just from wall street but from regulators  bond  rating agencies  the energy trading community and enron  s own employees  many of them angered by the devastation of their retirement accounts as the company  s stock has plunged   this year 
an employee lawsuit was filed monday in federal court in houston  alleging that enron misled workers about its profitability and breached its fiduciary duty by inducing them to buy company stock for their   k  retirement plans 
about    enron employees are owed a total of   million in compensation for losses sustained in their retirement accounts  said eli gottesdiener  whose washington firm represents the plaintiffs 
one of the plaintiffs  gary kemper  a maintenance foreman with enron  s portland general electric unit in oregon  said the total value of his   k  account has shrunk to     from     this year as his enron holdings collapsed to about     from     
 it wouldn  t tick me off so bad except that they were sending us e  mail after e  mail  last summer  saying things are fine   kemper said in an interview monday  referring to company executives   of course  we find out later that they were dumping their own stock  millions of dollars at a time  
enron chairman kenneth l  lay cashed in stock and options worth   million last year  when the stock was near its peak 
kemper and his wife had been planning to retire early  four years from now  but it is no longer clear that they will be able to afford it  he said 
another law firm representing enron employees  seattle  based hagens berman  is looking into the possibility of adding enron  s accounting firm as a defendant  partner karl barth said monday 
the accountant  andersen  has been criticized for failing to catch irregularities that caused enron to restate its earnings dating back to  and declare its previous financial reports unreliable 
egan  jones ratings co   a credit  rating agency in suburban philadelphia  on monday cut its rating on enron  s senior debt by one notch  saying the company will need   billion to     billion in the next  days to fund operating losses and other liabilities 
egan  jones dropped enron  s bonds to the sub  investment  grade  or junk  level in august  about when the company  s chief executive  jeffrey k  skilling  abruptly resigned  the agency  s view is more severe than those of larger rivals moody  s investors service and standard  poor  s  which both continue to keep enron  s debt in the investment  grade category 
sean egan  a managing director of egan  jones  said he views the chances of the merger going through at less than     and if the merger falls through  enron  s chances of survival are not very high  he said 
dynegy has kept mum about the deal since wednesday  when it said it was trying to speed regulatory approvals  wall street analysts have noted that dynegy could invoke terms of a  material adverse change  clause allowing it to modify or walk away from the deal if it determines that enron  s condition is markedly worse than it was when the deal was struck nov   
under the merger deal  enron shareholders would receive    dynegy share for each of their shares  that implied a value of     a share  more than double enron  s closing price monday  the gap indicates wall street  s doubts about whether the deal will get done 
elsewhere monday  the office of california atty  gen  bill lockyer reiterated that it will scrutinize the dynegy  enron merger on antitrust grounds 
analysts say california could use its power to delay the deal as a way to squeeze dynegy for better prices on long  term power contracts it negotiated during the height of the state  s energy crisis this year 
enron already is under investigation by the securities and exchange commission over controversial deals involving limited partnerships organized and run by former company executives

global investing  a creative approach to property liabilities

financial times

global investing  a creative approach to property liabilities  many big companies use  synthetic  leases to keep real estate costs off their balance sheets  reports alison beard 
synthetic leases were among the many creative financing techniques used by enron  the troubled energy trading company  but the structure  which allows companies to keep real estate costs off their balance sheets while claiming the tax benefits of ownership  is legal and used by dozens of companies from toys r us to yahoo  
 a synthetic lease is a debt alternative   said michael rotchford  senior managing director at cushman  wakefield  the real estate services firm   almost invariably for companies with good standing   it  will provide them with much lower ongoing expenses than traditional leases  
but shareholders should be wary of companies that are simply disguising their property liabilities   they  ve got long  term assets and they  re financed them with short  term means   says anne coolidge  executive director at wp carey  the real estate banking firm that specialises in sale leasebacks  an alternative to synthetic leases   traditionally equity analysts haven  t taken that into account  although debt analysts have  everyone should know about these things  
companies choose synthetic leases because traditional options  rental agreements or outright ownership  are often unattractive  ownership means tying up cash in non  core real estate assets  but renting is more expensive in the long term 
cisco systems  the networking equipment company  estimated in the mid   s that leasing would cost it    per cent more a year than owning its properties  at the same time  investors eager for double  digit profit growth were unlikely to tolerate a slowly appreciating real estate asset on the company  s balance sheet  so cisco chose synthetic leases 
the deals works as follows  a lender agrees to pay for a new development or an addition to a property  the company  s  rent  is the interest on that financing  set at a rate reflecting its credit standing and priced as a spread over the london interbank office rate  these payments are deducted from the company  s taxes 
meanwhile  the company acts as owner and manager of the property  assuming all risk  it sets aside money to purchase the property at the end of the lease  listing the earmarked funds as  restricted cash  or  long  term assets  on its balance sheet  sometimes the company can extend the lease at the end of the term or sell the property  but that is at the lender  s discretion 
although depreciation of the property  s value is not included on the company  s balance sheet  it can be listed as a tax deduction  so far  the financial accounting standards board has issued few guidelines on synthetic leases  but  it is a loophole  that allows  the ownership and the lease benefits to accrue to the same player   said gary declark  managing director of integra realty resources  the property appraisal and consulting firm   sooner or later  it will probably be closed up

usa  enron may cut price of dynegy deal by  percent  wsj 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
new york  nov   reuters   hobbled energy giant enron corp   in an effort to save its planned purchase by smaller rival dynegy inc   may cut the price of the all  stock transaction by more than  percent to about   billion  the wall street journal reported on tuesday 
enron also was negotiating to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings in order to stem a growing liquidity crisis according to people familiar with the matter  the paper said 
the move to renegotiate the agreement  and particularly to cut the number of dynegy shares that enron holders would receive  two weeks after the pact  s signing is virtually unheard of in corporate transactions  the wall street journal said 
escape clauses built into the deal give dynegy the option to back out if there is a serious deterioration in enron  s business or assets 
enron has total debt of about   billion  according to the wall street journal  adding that analysts are increasingly worried that the giant energy  trading concern  s relatively few hard assets are so burdened by debt that they cannot be used to bolster further borrowing 
dynegy  which is    percent owned by energy giant chevrontexaco corp   is to swap    share of its own stock for each share of enron  shares of dynegy closed at     on new york stock exchange trade 
once high  flying enron agreed to a dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems  including a u  s  regulatory probe of off  balance  sheet dealings by its officers  a     billion cut in shareholder equity  and cuts to its credit ratings 
enron subsequently restated its earnings some   million lower  and investor unease exploded and sent its shares tumbling  shares were above   in august

enron  dynegy discuss plan to cut price of acquisition
    
dow jones business news
 copyright  c    dow jones  company  inc  
enron corp   struggling to save its two  week  old deal to be acquired by dynegy inc   was in advanced discussions with dynegy to cut the price of the all  stock transaction by more than   to about   billion  people familiar with the matter told the wall street journal 
beleaguered enron  ene  also was in continuing negotiations to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings in order to stem a growing liquidity crisis  these people said  enron has total debt of about   billion  increasingly  analysts are worried that the giant energy  trading concern  s relatively few hard assets are so encumbered by debt that they can  t be used to support further borrowing 
enron stock slid to its lowest level in over a decade at  p  m  monday on the new york stock exchange  falling  cents to     a share  over the past few months  about   billion of enron  s stock value has evaporated  a process that has accelerated since mid  october when the company announced a quarterly loss and a subsequent reduction in its equity base  since then  revelations that company executives profited from partnerships used to move assets on and off enron  s books have spooked investors and triggered a securities and exchange commission investigation  recently  the company has twice restated earnings for past periods amid indications that its vaunted energy trading business is showing some signs of stress 
the move to renegotiate the acquisition agreement  and particularly to slash the number of dynegy  dyn  shares that enron holders would receive  only two weeks after the pact  s signing is virtually unheard of in corporate transactions  while terms are sometimes altered due to unanticipated developments  that typically doesn  t happen until a transaction is nearly completed 
enron had hoped to finalize arrangements and make an announcement monday that would calm its anxious investors  but the situation remained fluid throughout the day  as of monday evening  the revised deal still hadn  t been formalized 
the deal is critical for enron  in recent weeks  credit  rating agencies have indicated they will refrain from further cuts to enron  s credit rating so long as a dynegy purchase appears probable  but if that deal collapses  downgrades could occur that would put enron below investment grade and in violation of credit agreements with counterparties  this in turn could deal a savage blow to enron  s commodity  trading business that is its lifeblood 
negotiators for the two companies returned to their home bases of houston monday after spending much of the holiday weekend meeting in suburban new york where they tried to agree on new provisions to the deal  which was announced nov    both dynegy and enron declined to comment on the discussions

houston  ap   executives of dynegy inc  plan to announce new terms for their   billion buyout offer for enron corp  as shares in enron continue to fall  according to the houston chronicle 
sources familiar with talks between the two companies told the newspaper that the announcement could come as soon as tuesday 
the sources said officials of the two houston  based energy traders spent the weekend and monday discussing a lower exchange rate for rival dynegy  s stock deal to buy enron  among other issues 
but as of monday evening  no exchange rate had been agreed to and discussions were continuing  the sources said  cautioning that the situation continued to change 
the sources said enron and dynegy were working to finalize terms for an equity infusion into enron of around   million that  s expected to come from j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup  another equity infusion from other parties was also possible later  the sources said 
layoffs by enron were expected to begin sometime this week  according to the report  enron spokeswoman karen denne said any action the company would take concerning job cuts would be communicated first to employees 
enron shares fell another  percent monday  and briefly traded below their all  time low  as investors continued to doubt that a   billion buyout offer from dynegy would be completed under the current terms 
  
sizable staff of  lawyers in merger limbo
houston  ap   the fate of enron corp   s massive legal staff has been a subject of discussion amid talk of possible layoffs at the troubled energy trader 
the company  s legal staff size is larger than some law firms 
 we  ve always regarded them as one of the big law firms in houston   said howard ayers  managing partner of andrews  kurth  one of the city  s largest with about  lawyers in houston 
enron has about  lawyers worldwide  company spokesman vance meyer said  with about  lawyers in houston  if it were a private firm it would have been the city  s sixth  largest  according to the chronicle 
enron  s internal law office has grown along with the huge trading firm  now set to merge with smaller but stronger dynegy  as enron  s stock plummeted further  dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave enron to face possible bankruptcy 
speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that enron will hold on tightly to its talent 
 my guess is they  ll need their lawyers while they get things in a more steady state  there  s a lot of legal work to go through   said joel swanson  a senior partner at baker  botts  a law firm with about  lawyers in houston 
in addition to enron  s in  house legal staff  the company also has hired just about every large firm in houston over the last few years

money make  over club sticks together through thick  thin

like a lot of investors  the women taking stock investment club got to the great bull market of the  s just as the party was coming to an end 
dazzled by watching others reap double  digit returns in the stock market year after year  the group of westside friends decided to form an investment club and get in on the fun 
it hasn  t exactly been a joy ride 
a victim of bad timing  the club made its first purchase in late  and continued building its portfolio over the next three years as the market peaked and then plunged   taking many of the club  s holdings with it 
five of the club  s selections have lost more than half their purchase price  and some of the worst performers have shed two  thirds of their value  with their portfolio awash in red ink  club members have been paralyzed into inaction 
 we are not comfortable selling anything   said gail berlant  a founder of the   member group   and we are hesitant to buy  although we think it might be a good time  
what makes the downdraft more difficult to stomach is that the club thought it was employing a safe strategy  it chose mostly well  known companies it expected to be steady performers  avoiding riskier choices  and unlike many investment clubs  women taking stock diversified its holdings and resisted the temptation to buy internet stocks  a once  hot sector that burned many investors when it crashed 
the group  s portfolio includes several well  known names in pharmaceuticals  entertainment  energy and financial services  although their few technology choices  including cisco systems and applied materials  have contributed to their fall  they  ve also lost big on non  tech stocks such as retailer gap 
despite the declines  the club members are determined not to give up  they intend to stick together   defying the trend among many investment clubs to disband in the face of the grinding bear market  and although they are still solidly on the losing side of the ledger  there are some factors that bode well for the group  s future 
for one thing  the stakes are relatively modest  members contribute   to join and chip in   a month  no one is counting on the club to pay for a child  s college costs or to fund a retirement  the club  s entire portfolio is currently worth less than     
in addition  members see the group as a way to learn about investing  not as a road to instant riches   we look at this as a learning process   berlant said 
perhaps most important  club members learn from their mistakes  for instance  they realize that their stock selection has lacked focus  particularly in the early days 
 each meeting  people would present stocks they had read about in newspapers and in better investing   a publication of the national assn  of investors corp   an umbrella group for clubs  said sandy roberts  the club  s president 
using that approach  many of the club  s early investments were in companies that members were familiar with  high  profile names such as disney  coca  cola and gap   we thought gap  s tv commercials were fantastic   member susan osti said 
the results were disappointing  even given the stock market  s overall decline  gap  for example  has lost   since the club bought it  the standard  poor  s index of retail stocks is down about   during that same period 
after several of their other early choices tanked   the club  s worldcom shares  purchased in october   are down     the club members decided to adopt a more systematic approach to stock  picking 
 a year ago  a stock broker friend of ours told us that we should focus on certain industries and assign people to research stocks within those industries   member penny berro said   so we divided up some industries  among the members  and started by looking at pharmaceuticals and energy  
in the pharmaceutical field  the group settled on pfizer  which has risen   since the club purchased it in march  and johnson  johnson  which also sells consumer products and is up   since march 
in energy  the club narrowed its choice to enron and dynegy  at the time  enron was getting bad publicity for its role in california  s electricity woes  leaving the women feeling uncomfortable with buying stock in the houston  based company 
 there were no red flags with dynegy   vicki whitney said   it was diversified and seemed like it could withstand problems better than enron  
the choice has proved to a wise one  relatively speaking  enron  enmeshed in an accounting scandal  is down   since july  dynegy has been hurt by a sharp downturn in energy stocks that accompanied the recent fall in oil prices  but is down a comparatively mild   since the club bought it  ironically  part of dynegy  s current slide is due to its proposed acquisition of enron 
club members asked times business editors to review their portfolio  in a recent meeting with the group  senior markets editor tom petruno encouraged club members not to be too hard on themselves  noting that they avoided the mistake made by many investment clubs  concentrating too much   or all   of their money in volatile tech stocks 
 you have some failures  but you  ve also done some things right   petruno said   you arrived late in the market  but you  ve got good asset allocation  
but he warned that selecting stocks such as gap and disney merely because they are large or well  known is not necessarily a sound strategy   it used to be that you couldn  t go wrong with gap   petruno said   now you can go very wrong  just because a company is big and has a huge brand name doesn  t guarantee anything  
he suggested that the members stick to their commitment to dig into a company  s financial condition and competitive position before investing 
 read annual reports and quarterly reports and really look at a company  s fundamentals   petruno said   ask yourself what  s going on with the company  are you comfortable with management  what  s the company  s focus  if it  s having problems  how does it plan to get back on track  
club members should be wary of companies with a lot of debt on their books  he said  particularly if club members expect the current economic downturn to be prolonged   what  s reasonable debt in a good economy may not be reasonable in a bad economy   he said   creditors tend to get nervous in a bad economy  debt can sink a company  
the club should compare debt  to  equity ratios for companies in the same industry to determine if a company  s debt load is unusually heavy  petruno said 
martin zimmerman  times assistant business editor for markets  also warned the club to resist buying stocks that appear to be cheap just because they  ve fallen a long way from their highs   even if you find a viable company that may be priced at    a share  after once being priced at    that doesn  t make it a bargain   he said   it may only ever be worth    or worse  it may only be worth    
the club deserves credit for going against conventional wisdom by buying stocks in industries that may be momentarily out of favor  petruno said 
referring to the club  s decision in august to buy more shares of cisco systems  petruno said   i  m glad you  re not succumbing to the temptation not to look at anything in tech  a lot of people who lost money in that area won  t go near it  but there will be survivors  and fortunes can be made by picking stocks when no one else likes them  
refining its buying discipline is only one of the club  s challenges  investors also need to know when to sell  women taking stock has sold only one stock in its history  and it sold that one  compaq computer  only after the company  s shares lost a third of their value and a friend in the securities industry urged them to unload the stock 
meanwhile  stocks that have shed more than half their value  such as gap  worldcom and applied materials  remain in their portfolio 
 our goal was to buy stocks that would double in five years   berlant said   that  s why we haven  t sold anything  
one way to take make the decision easier is for club members to set a limit on how much they  re willing to lose on a stock  petruno suggested  if a stock drops    for example  the club could unload it or at least agree to take a critical look to determine whether it  s worth sticking with 
 it  s easy to say that a stock is going to come back  but they don  t always come back   he said   many times  a   loss can turn into a   or   loss  you need a point where you will take a hard look and decide whether you need to cut your losses  
one thing club members agree on  although their initiation into investing has come during the worst bear market in three decades  they  re determined to stay the course 
 we realize that we got into the market late   roberts said   but we  ve learned a lot and we  re not discouraged  we  re definitely going to hang in there

enron  dynegy to rework   b deal
by claire poole in houston
    
the daily deal
copyright  c   the deal llc
houston energy company dynegy has reportedly reopened talks with its ailing crosstown rival since the collapse of enron  s stock price  which has been sliced in half since the acquisition was announced 
houston energy company dynegy inc  has returned to the bargaining table and is talking with ailing crosstown rival enron corp  and related parties about modifying their   billion merger agreement  according to sources close to the deal 
the two power traders are in a  friendly renegotiation   sources say   all the parties are talking as it relates to terms and conditions   one person said 
the main reason for rekindling the talks is the collapse of enron  s stock price  which has been sliced in half since the acquisition was announced nov   for   billion in cash  stock and debt assumption 
the deal valued enron  s shares at      a   premium over its     close before the announcement  but enron  s shares have fallen steadily since  closing monday at      down nearly   on the day 
dynegy  s stock has also lost about   of its value since the deal was announced  closing down     nov   to     
john olson  a longtime enron follower at sanders morris harris in houston  thinks dynegy might be pushing for     per share   that  s closer to the reality of the current market   he said 
if dynegy can  t work out a better deal  another course might be to allow enron to slip into bankruptcy  according to sources 
with enron  s stock price slipping and only   billion in cash remaining  olson thinks it  s the wiser of the two options   would enron be better off to go bankrupt or get nickeled and dimed to death by wall street that is not in love with this deal   he asks   chapter  looks more sensible to me  
olson said if enron can get   billion in debtor financing  bankruptcy would be preferable to anything else   the lower stock price  the higher probability  of chapter     he said   investors  creditors and bankers all want some closure on this  
olson speculates that only the sick part of enron   the parent and the trading operations  which are worth about     billion   would file for bankruptcy  while the healthy part   the pipeline and energy outsourcing assets  which are worth around   billion   would be left out 
 you  d end up with a  good bank  bad bank  profile   he said  referring to the strategy many financial firms followed when they went bust in the  s 
dynegy would be an obvious buyer of the pipeline and energy outsourcing assets  it already has an option to buy enron  s northern natural gas co  pipeline system if the deal doesn  t go through  in exchange for its     billion investment in enron at the deal  s signing  provided by investor chevrontexaco corp   of san francisco 
if dynegy walks away from the deal  it would have to pay a   million breakup fee plus   million in expenses 
enron spokesman vance meyer wouldn  t comment on whether it was renegotiating the deal with dynegy  he also wouldn  t speculate on whether the firm was considering bankruptcy as an option if a new deal with dynegy couldn  t be worked out 
a dynegy spokesman said the status of the proposed merger has not changed   our due diligence is ongoing   he said 
right now  credit rating agencies are hesitating before they downgrade enron  s ratings to junk status  which could further pressure enron  s day  to  day business operations and lead it faster to insolvency 
 it  s a fluid situation   said ralph pellecchia  senior director at new york rating agency fitch inc   which has enron  s bond ratings at one level above junk   there  s a lot of conjecture about enron  s dealings with dynegy and the banks  we  ll just have to wait until there  s another event or announcement before we act  
according to fitch  enron is sitting on about     billion in cash      billion as it reported in its quarterly report to the u  s  securities and exchange commission nov   and   million it took down last week from a   billion credit line extended by its investment bankers on the dynegy deal  j  p  morgan and salomon smith barney inc 
late last week  enron also managed to extend the deadline on   million in partnership  related debt that was due monday until mid  december  although fitch would like to see it extended further   mid  december doesn  t help enron much   pellecchia said 
the payment obligation arose because a clause in a financial agreement was triggered when rating agency standard  poor  s reduced enron  s senior unsecured debt rating to triple  b  minus nov   
if its credit rating is further reduced  enron admitted it risks triggering     billion in additional debt payments  which would result in the company failing to be a  going concern   according to quarterly filing  paying off these debts would mean the company could not service its revolving credit accounts 
fixed  income research service creditsights said the goal of the banks now is to  re  cut their exposure to gain as much structural seniority or asset liens as possible  take out fees  raise rates  take down total exposure and generally improve their risk  profile under multiple scenarios  
carol levenson  an analyst for gimmecredit  another fixed  income research service  thinks it will leave the unsecured bondholders holding the bag 
 the very bankers who are supplying liquidity through new secured bank lines and who are rumored to be considering equity investments are the ones on the hook  and unsecured  for   billion in bank loans    she wrote in a research report issued monday   if dynegy backs out  in the interest of self  preservation   these vital bank renegotiations might save enron but leave unsecured bondholders as the patsies   
investors and employees  meanwhile  are still suing enron 
eli gottesdiener  an attorney in washington  d  c   said monday he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of enron employees who have lost an estimated   million on enron stock held in their   k  retirement accounts  he charges that enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling enron shares to employees without issuing a prospectus 
the suit is the third filed against enron alleging the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices  all three seek class  action status 
gottesdiener is also involved in pension class actions against new york life insurance co  and sbc communications inc  of san antonio 
reworking the details dynegy has returned to the bargaining table and is talking with ailing crosstown rival enron and related parties about modifying their   billion merger agreement  according to sources close to the deal

india  enron india unit  lenders to meet in uk this week 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
bombay  nov   reuters   enron corp  s troubled indian unit and its foreign lenders will hold separate meetings this week to decide the fate of a power project once considered the showpiece of india  s reform programme  a banking source said on tuesday 
the meetings  to be held in london on friday and saturday  will consider proposals to allow the dabhol power company  which is  percent owned by enron  to pull the plug on a contract to sell power from a giant power project  he said 
the     billion     mw project  which is india  s largest foreign direct investment  has been shut since june this year following a dispute with its sole buyer the maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  
the departure of enron and its partners would be another blow to attempts to attract foreign investment into the domestic power sector 
five foreign companies have either pulled out or announced plans to exit the sector  fed up with bureaucratic delays and legal wrangling over the past few years 
at the same time  parent enron corp of the united states is struggling to ward off bankruptcy and save its proposed buyout by smaller rival dynegy inc 
its share price has already taken a beating this year over widespread investor doubts about its corporate governance practices  enron shares closed down  cents  or    percent  at     on the new york stock exchange  nyse  on monday  after dipping to at least an   year  low of     
a dabhol spokesman in bombay confirmed that the dabhol board is meeting in november  in london  but he declined to disclose the agenda 
the banking source said the dabhol board will consider giving the management authorisation to issue a final termination notice to the mseb 
foreign lenders  led by citibank and bank of america  are meeting in london on the same day and will also consider giving dabhol permission to issue such a notice 
under a  agreement between dabhol and mseb in   the company needs lenders  permission before issuing a terminating notice 
once issued  the notice would trigger international arbitration to resolve arguments over damages 
mega project
dabhol and mseb have been feuding for more than a year over payment defaults and high tariffs  the dispute stopped work on the second phase of the unit which is  percent complete 
enron and its fellow u  s  investors general electric co and bechtel  fed up with payment defaults  have already announced their intentions to exit the project 
they have agreed to sell their stake of  percent to either the indian government or a private power company  at the same time  they have also proceeded with plans to cancel the contract 
a preliminary cancellation notice was issued in may this year  this was to be followed up by a final termination notice after six months  that six  month deadline expired on november  
but dabhol was prevented from taking the final step by a bombay court  acting on an urgent petition by indian lenders  who were against the termination  the court asked dabhol not to issue such a notice until december  
the banking source said dabhol is only trying to secure all approvals and would not actually issue the notice on november

a former employee of the dabhol power corporation dpc  sheikh had sent an email threatening to blow up dpcs guhagar plant

companies  finance the americas  demand for electricity re  energises gas project

companies  finance the americas  demand for electricity re  energises gas project  after more than  years  gas pipeline companies are revisiting us  canadian plans  writes dan westell 
the vision of a booming demand for electricity has brought a large part of the north american natural gas pipeline industry together to revive a   year  old mega  project 
it was the late  s when the us and canadian governments first approved a consortium to bring gas from the north slope in alaska to markets in the lower  states 
that project foundered as gas prices sagged  but last week  the original pipeline partners  six us and three canadian companies  agreed to make a new approach to the alaskan gas producers by the end of the year 
a second gas project  a proposal by canadian producers who own undeveloped fields in canada  s arctic  is also hoping to launch a pipeline project this year 
after coming to terms with indigenous peoples in the north  the canadian group hopes next month to begin preparing regulatory filings for a pipeline from the mackenzie river delta down the mackenzie valley to the south 
after years of quiet in the northern energy front  there is a very real prospect that gas from one project  or perhaps even both projects  could be flowing by  
certainly  politics has something to do with the change  especially the reactions to california  s electricity problems and worries about security of supply  heightened by terrorism and problems in the middle east 
for the companies  however  long  term pipeline projects are driven by forecasts showing a nearly  per cent increase in us gas consumption by  
the extra gas will largely be used to generate electricity  said rocco ciancio  spokesman for foothills pipe lines  one of the three canadian companies in the pipeline group that is preparing its pitch to the alaskan producers 
the pipelines  revived interest in moving alaskan gas was propelled by gas spot prices  which hit usdollars    per mmbtu on january  
other groups were already in motion  including the canadian producers  led by imperial oil   which have large undeveloped gas fields in the mackenzie river delta 
the north slope producers  exxonmobil  bp and phillips  began their own study early this year to assess two routes     miles running east under the beaufort sea from prudhoe bay to the mackenzie delta  then south  or    miles following existing roads through the alaskan interior to alberta 
the higher prices are now a memory as gas has slid back to usdollars    per mmbtu  but the wheels on all three proposals continue to turn 
the pipeline group  canada  s transcanada pipelines and westcoast energy  which together own foothills  and affiliates of us companies williams  duke energy  sempra energy international  enron  pg  e and el paso  is planning a usdollars    bn project to carry  bn cu ft a day  it needs a price of usdollars  per mmbtu to be viable 
the north slope companies produce about  bn cu ft of gas a day  a byproduct with oil  in prudhoe bay  but reinject it into the ground  there is no way of getting it or the known reserves of    bn cu ft  let alone the potential reserves of    cu ft  to market 
the preliminary results of their study  however  show a price of usdollars  per mmbtu and falls short of the  per cent return on equity target set in the study  said spokesman curtis thayer 
they want to ship more gas than the pipelines are proposing  requiring a bigger pipe  and believe the project will require not just the new northern pipeline  but expansion of the existing     mile system between alberta and chicago to handle the increased volume 
all in  they have priced the alaska route at usdollars    bn  and the beaufort  mackenzie route at usdollars    bn 
new technology or changes in project parameters could cut the cost  bridging some of the gap between the foothills group and the producers  but the producers are also pushing governments to lower regulatory costs and bring more certainty to tax issues

the americas  bolivia urged to handle its new  found wealth with care

the americas  bolivia urged to handle its new  found wealth with care  gas reserves  the country needs to diversify its customer base if energy discoveries are to prove a long  term cure for economic ills  and an alternative to the cocaine trade  paul keller reports 
the discovery of large natural gas reserves in bolivia has led some to believe that the landlocked south american country has found a long  term cure for its economic ills  and an alternative to the cocaine trade 
true  reserves are plentiful  analysts say  but an excess of supply and the risk that this fragile andean economy comes to rely too heavily on hydrocarbon revenues suggest bolivia must handle gas with care 
 we have told the government  gas is not the saviour of bolivia   says steven hopper  the general manager of transredes  the enron  shell gas transport utility   this is a critical time for bolivia as it has to find markets for its gas  the industry is generally optimistic  the worst scenario is that gas demand in brazil doesn  t grow  
the strategy of president jorge quiroga  a   year  old technocrat who took over from ailing ex  president hugo banzer in august  is to help bolivia go from being a world coca leaf grower to gas producer and regional energy hub  it is a strategy  analysts say  already paying dividends 
 bolivia is only now beginning to realise some of the return on its gas flowing to brazil   says one western observer   gas is seen as leading element in mid  to long  term recovery  
to speed up the anticipated benefits  bolivia is considering selling securities backed by tax receipts from future gas sales  the government plans to securitise one  third of the income from gas sales to brazil over the next  years 
the     bn mining and agriculture  dominated economy  one of latin america  s smallest  has been in a three  year downturn as internal demand evaporates and the value of exports plummets  us  sponsored eradication of coca and cocaine production also removed a significant chunk of revenue 
thus the riches and influence promised by gas symbolise hope in a country better known in recent decades for social turmoil  military coups  nazi asylum  seekers and the once  omnipresent drugs trade 
oil and gas were the only industrial sectors to show growth this year  in the first seven months gas production rose by    per cent year on year  output of oil  extracted during gas production  grew    per cent 
gearing up for greater brazilian demand  capacity is being increased on bolivia  s existing gas pipeline  a petrobras  repsol  ypf and totalfinaelf consortium hopes to start building a rival pipeline 
but for the multinationals that have invested in bolivia  s gas market  the worry is that southern cone demand will not keep pace with supply 
although not as big as bolivia  s reserves  argentina and peru also have gas to develop and export  while brazil has vast energy needs  bolivia needs to diversify its gas customer base  analysts say 
with proven and probable bolivian reserves of    bn cu ft and another    bn cu ft of possible reserves  only venezuela  with    bn cu ft of reserves  has more gas in south america 
the amount of gas found has grown eightfold since bolivia opened up its gas market in   however current demand for gas in the southern cone is estimated at around only    bn cu ft 
in the quest for new markets  the government has backed a plan to ship natural gas to the energy  hungry us west coast  but even with strong commercial backing  the   bn project  led by pacific lng  a consortium made up of spain  s repsol  ypf  british gas and british petroleum  must still negotiate a number of political and technical hurdles to succeed  analysts say 
the project in its present form requires a   bn   km pipeline across the andes linking the chilean coast with bolivia  s largest gas field  margarita  owned by the consortium 
liquefied gas could then be shipped to mexico and piped into the us  it all needs careful negotiation both with the governments involved and us gas distributors  but la paz is optimistic that the project will be shipping gas to the us within five years 
mr quiroga  who steps down next year  has spearheaded efforts to open up the us gas market  he recently predicted gas would  open doors  for bolivia 
he also hopes to persuade chile to grant it access to the pacific in return for choosing a chilean port as the site for a   bn liquefaction plant needed in the pacific lng project  peru is vying to receive bolivian gas  but analysts expect chile to win out 
however  analysts continue to warn mr quiroga not to overplay the  gas card   bearing in mind both that the industry will not create masses of new jobs as well as the country  s over  reliance in the past on expendable resources such as silver and tin 
luis felipe rivero  the general manager of the financial group bisa  says   there are great expectations that gas will become one of the principal generators of revenue and a creator of investment in bolivia 
 but because of these expectations  there is a risk of letting slip the country  s basic problems which are a lack of education  a lack of health services  lack of job opportunities and corruption

usa  update   enron lawsuit seen as wake  up call for pensions 
by andrew kelly
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
houston  nov   reuters   a washington  d  c   lawyer said monday he hopes heavy losses suffered by enron corp  employees will spur congress to limit employee investments in their employers  stock through   k  retirement plans 
 how many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings before congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amount of company stock that can be in a   k  plan   lawyer eli gottesdiener asked 
gottesdiener released a statement monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated   million on enron stock held in their   k  retirement accounts 
the suit is one of four filed against enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices 
two similar suits were announced last week and the seattle law firm of dalton gotto samson  kilgard also announced one on monday  all four suits seek class  action status 
enron  s shares have fallen from a high of   in august  to less than   today  their decline accelerating since oct  amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances 
like many other companies  enron makes matching contributions to its employees    k  retirement accounts in its own stock  it also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn  
enron employees were also prevented from selling enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from mid  october due to a change in the retirement plan  s administrator 
gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than  percent of a portfolio in a single stock  but that participants in   k  plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold  percent of their portfolio in that stock 
 congress sensibly placed a  percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in   but at the behest of the corporate lobby  it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans   he said 
the absence of such a cap in defined  contribution   k  plans was  completely indefensible   he said 
gottesdiener  s suit alleges that enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus  if proven  this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases  he said 
gottesdiener is also involved in class action pensions litigation against new york life insurance co  and sbc communications inc

usa  calif  attorney gen  l to examine dynegy  enron deal 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
sacramento  calif   nov   reuters   california  s attorney general will examine dynegy inc   s bid to buy its much larger energy rival  enron corp   officials said monday  adding a potential new wrinkle to the troubled   billion merger proposal 
 we are reviewing the merger for anti  trust concerns   said sandra michioku  spokeswoman for attorney general bill lockyer 
michioku said it was still far too early to say what position california would take on the proposed merger  which involves two companies often publicly blamed for helping to create california  s energy crisis this year 
dynegy was among five energy companies named in a lawsuit filed in may by lt  gov  cruz bustamante alleging energy price manipulation at several southern california power plants it owns  dynegy has denied the accusation 
enron  while owning no generation plants in california  is a major national player for energy trading and natural gas transmission  which if merged with dynegy  s market presence in the state could create a major new energy powerhouse 
the proposed merger  which has been plagued by uncertainty amid news of major new enron debt and a resulting slump in its share price  is already being examined by the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission 
california regulators could present a roadblock to successful completion of the deal  but the state could also leverage its influence over the merger to renegotiate a number of long  term energy deals with dynegy  which it signed months ago at the height of its power crisis and which are now being criticized as a bad deal for the state  s consumers

dynegy may modify enron purchase terms  people say  update  
         new york 
dynegy may modify enron purchase terms  people say  update  
 adds reports on stock ratio and bank extensions in seventh
and eighth paragraphs  
houston  nov    bloomberg    dynegy inc  may renegotiate
terms of its proposed     billion purchase of enron corp   whose
shares have fallen  percent since the merger was announced 
people familiar with talks between the companies said 
executives of the two energy  trading companies discussed
possible changes in the terms over the weekend  the people said 
the offer made on nov   values enron at     a share in dynegy
stock  enron  s stock closed at      indicating investors don  t
believe the sale will be completed under the original terms 
enron is seeking as much as   billion in equity investment
and moody  s investors service is weighing whether to downgrade the
credit rating of the energy trader  which said last week its debt
was higher than earlier reported  enron needs to offer more
attractive terms or risk losing the support of dynegy investors
for a deal needed to save the company  analysts said 
  the choices are fairly stark  renegotiate the deal or file
for chapter     said john olson  an analyst with sanders morris
harris 
neither enron spokeswoman karen denne nor dynegy spokesman
john sousa would comment on whether talks on a new buyout
agreement are underway 
current terms call for an exchange ratio of    share of
dynegy stock for each enron share  given recent disclosures about
enron  s debt and the drop in the stock price  a fairer ratio would
be    share of dynegy  said ronald barone  a ubs warburg analyst
who rates dynegy a   strong buy   
half price 
enron and dynegy are talking about cutting the ratio to less
than     which would value the stock portion of the transaction
at about   billion  or less than   per enron share  the wall
street journal reported  citing people close to the discussions 
in addition  the companies may announce as early as today an
extension by some banks on the repayment of enron  s debt  a  
million cash infusion from citigroup inc  and j  p  morgan chase 
co   and an agreement that would keep the purchase intact despite
lawsuits over enron  s employee  retirement plan  the new york times
said 
  if they can renegotiate the deal to half  the original
price   that  s where you get really attractive earnings    said
gordon howald  an analyst at credit lyonnais who rates dynegy a
  buy   
under current terms  the deal makes sense for dynegy only if
enron earns  cents or more  howald said  barone has reduced his
estimate of enron  s  earnings from     a share to  cents 
dynegy shares fell      or    percent  to     
additional financing
new terms may not be necessary if enron can get the
additional   billion in financing it  s seeking  some investors
said 
  if people who  ve looked at enron are willing to put in that
kind of money  it sends a message that their core businesses  
trading  pipelines and energy management   are still sound   
said kathleen vuchetich  who helps manage     billion in assets
in the strong utilities fund     percent of which is dynegy
stock 
enron has debt payments of more than   billion due before the
end of   and has less than   billion in cash and credit lines
left  the company said in a filing last week  if its cash reserves
run too low  enron  s credit rating may be cut below investment
grade  that would trigger     billion in debt repayments for two
affiliated partnerships 
moody  s investors service hasn  t issued a report on enron
since the company filed a   q quarterly report with the
securities and exchange commission last week  on nov    it rated
enron  s debt one notch above junk  the rating company  s analysts
didn  t return calls seeking comment today 
egan  jones ratings co  lowered its rating on enron  s credit
today to   bb    from   bb    a level below investment grade 
write  off
the houston  based company also said in the filing that it had
a   million note due this week  and that it may have to reduce
fourth  quarter earnings by   million  the write  off would come
because it used stock to guarantee debt owed by an affiliated
partnership  and the value of that stock has plunged 
on wednesday  enron got a three  week reprieve from lenders on
the   million note and closed on a   million credit line 
dynegy chief executive officer chuck watson said he was
  encouraged   by the developments 
enron is negotiating to restructure its other debt  denne
said today  j  p  morgan and citigroup executives met today to line
up investors willing to buy   billion in bonds convertible into
enron stock 
many of enron  s trading partners are shunning the company 
and some analysts now say enron  s  earnings may hurt  rather
than boost  dynegy  s earnings  as watson has projected 
deteriorating daily
  the value of the assets dynegy is trying to buy   the
trading and marketing businesses   are deteriorating on a daily
basis as more counterparties back off on trading and dealing with
enron    said mike heim  a securities analyst at a  g  edwards dynegy shares remain above their predeal levels 
wishful thinking
a dynegy spokesman says his company can post annual earnings growth of   to   over the next two years even without enron  he declined to comment on the merger negotiations  except to say that dynegy is  continuing its due diligence  of enron  an enron spokesman declined to comment on deal talks 
where do things stand as of monday evening  well  the deal looks increasingly unlikely to happen  at least on the terms of nov     after a sickening slide last week  enron tanked again monday  dropping   to      current deal terms have dynegy paying around     an enron share based on its current stock price  a   gap says the deal won  t get done  but  as the world and his wife now know  the deal needs to go through for enron to maintain the investment grade credit rating necessary for its survival 
clearly  every hour counts in this fast  unwinding situation  enron  s core trading business is in deep trouble as power market players cut exposure to the company  draining it of precious cash 
as a result  two options exist from here  the first is a rescue effort involving dynegy  the rating agencies and bank creditors like j  p  morgan chase and citigroup  working to revise the merger agreement and find more cash to buy enron time  this could involve changing the stock  swap ratio to give dynegy a cheaper price  with the banks possibly extending debt and joining with other investors to inject equity 
the other scenario has dynegy  after seeing the cash hemorrhage and the skeletons in the closet  deciding to back out altogether  leaving enron with no rescuer and no future  but dynegy  s resilient stock price suggests that the market hasn  t grasped the impact an enron bankruptcy would have on dynegy and other trading firms 
don  t be at all surprised if  any moment now  we see one last attempt to salvage dynegy  s rescue merger with new terms  several banks are exposed to enron and  presumably  they will try almost anything   including extending debt   to keep the company afloat  by keeping deeply distressed enron at an investment  grade rating  rating agencies such as moody  s have shown themselves willing to bend to the banks  wishes  so they will probably capitulate again if pressured by bank honchos 
be careful what you wish for
but swallowing enron would hardly be good for dynegy  which appears to have underestimated the former  s problems 
amazingly  just a couple of weeks back  the company expected enron to make     per share in   goldman sachs is now expecting  cents  even if the merger gets done  if dynegy ended up paying  say    a share for enron  people would no doubt hail that as a low  enough price to cover worsened fundamentals  legal liabilities and any nasty surprises that could spring from enron  s notoriously murky books  but recall that dynegy also would be taking on enron  s   billion of debt  include the debt in some return  on  capital calculations and the deal still looks untenable 
alternatively  enron may be deteriorating too fast to save  that  s also bad for dynegy  the damage done to the company by depleted energy market activity has been recognized  as has the risk that an enron collapse could leave dynegy dangerously unhedged on many of its trades  what does that mean and why is it dangerous  let  s say dynegy agreed to buy power from company x over a period of time and then sell it to enron  if enron goes down  its obligation to buy from dynegy obviously disappears  but dynegy can  t easily back out of the commitment to buy power from company x 
and there  s another potential risk that the market really hasn  t recognized  enron allegedly was very aggressive in booking upfront profits on forward market deals  an enron spokesman declined to comment on that allegation  those deals had to be done with other trading houses  possibly dynegy 
in other words  enron  s ways may have contaminated the whole market because  as we are frequently told  enron was the energy market  just as drexel burnham was the junk bond market in the   s  in enron  s absence  many of the aggressive deals may have to be unwound  meanwhile  auditors  in a frantic bid to cover their behinds  would start telling trading companies to be a lot more conservative in how much profit they book on forward deals  suddenly  fat margin deals evaporate and earnings estimates get slashed 
checkmate   for both sides
