louise 
this is incomplete with some bids expected next week  a lot of companies had a late start due to the  th of july holiday so they have been whining this week about an extension  bids are preliminary and based solely on the info memo  bids are in addition to all sunk costs 
mccook metals    mm  this is an ongoing  slow negotiation 
ppl global    mm
reliant   mm
indicated that they will submit bid later today  over weekend  early next week 
calpine
allegheny
aes
sempra
williams
el paso
nrg
dynegy
i expect some of these wont show up 
out for various reasons 
mirant
constellation
entergy
fpl
pg  e
orion
pseg
tractabel
if we end up with    positive bids  even if they are non  binding  i think it supports risking additional capital to get this project fully developed  sold  dash in process  
one interesting note  allegheny wants to see our offer  if we have several reasonable bids         it might make sense to offer a high outlier 
i will update
