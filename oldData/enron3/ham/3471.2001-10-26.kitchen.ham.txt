the exposure goes up   mm    mm per month up to the equipment contract cost of   mm for an incremental dash of approx   mm  with interest   chip and i talked about approving the full amount  but checking monthly with you and him as to whether or not we want to continue payments  an alternative is to dash  more months now and formally evaluate our position at year  end

chip will want to talk with you about the longview equipment  we are circulating a dash to enable us to continue making payments  if we do not continue to make payments  we forfeit the equipment and take a   mm hit  this is approximately   of the total equipment contract  i think the equipment is worth more  than    and i believe that we will get out of this problem with less than a   mm hit  i therefore recommend that we commit the extra  for this equipment  it will continue to be funded off b  s 
we continue to have discussions  negotiations with calpine  nrg and transalta  we have also opened up general equipment discussions with mirant and aes 
regards
