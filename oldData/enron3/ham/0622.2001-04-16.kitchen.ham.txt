Subject lv cogen non  recourse debt
i was incorrect  the existing non  recourse debt for las vegas    mm  is off  balance sheet and off  credit  it does not show up as a liability on our balance sheet and it is not part of our footnotes  if the plant blew up  we would be out   mm  not   mm  we get this treatment because it is a fair market value asset and we have a friend of enron minority investor that keeps our stated interest below    our interest for control purposes is over   because we have a call option on the friend of enron shares
