washington   dow jones   any merger deal that may emerge between dynegy inc   dyn  and enron corp   ene  will face a complicated and time  consuming regulatory  review process  legal experts said thursday 
any equity deal would require approvals from numerous u  s  federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators  as well as survive canadian and european antitrust reviews  energy attorneys contacted by dow jones newswires said 
a merger would require approvals from the federal energy regulatory commission  securities and exchange commission  department of justice and federal trade commission  and the illinois commerce commission likely would weigh into the mix  since dynegy owns illinova  s illinois power co 
any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by enron  s ownership of portland general electric co  while enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to northwest natural gas co   nwn   a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications 
a key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential enron  dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail  the attorneys said 
financially wounded enron is the nation  s largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines 
dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing 
the transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at ferc  where the merger application would challenge the commission  s merger  review policy  attorneys said

new york  nov   reuters   national power and gas marketer newpower holdings inc  revised its  loss guidance downward on thursday and saw its stock post its best one  day gain in two months 
the projection came in newpower  s report of a third quarter net loss of     million  or     per share  compared to a net loss of     million  or     per share for the third quarter of  
analysts had expected a per  share loss of     to      according to research firm thomson financial  first call  which put the consensus at

during the third quarter  newpower said  it gained about    new customers through the company  s marketing efforts  primarily in the residential sector  newpower recently increased its emphasis on small business customers and at the end of september had over    small business accounts  newpower expects this to increase to more than    by the end of the year 
providing revised guidance for the rest of the year  the company said it expects a net loss of   million to   million or a loss per share of  cents to  cents for the fourth quarter  the full year net loss is estimated to be between   million and   million  or     to     per share 
analysts  estimates of the year per share loss range from     to      resulting in a consensus per share loss projection of     
newpower said it projects the year  end customer count will be between    and     of which the fourth  quarter increase is expected to be achieved entirely through marketing 
it said the revised forecast reflects a reduction in the number of customers the company expects to acquire through portfolio acquisitions and the impact of delays in switching texas customers to newpower  partly offset by the company  s modified marketing strategies and continued cost reductions

 c  reuters limited  
new york  nov   reuters   utility holding company firstenergy corp  sold   billion of five     and   year debt on thursday  helped by investors  preference for defensive sectors as the u  s  economy stalls 
firstenergy was able to lower its borrowing costs  trimming yields from initial indications  the sale originally was expected to offer generous yields as heavy bond issuance  weak wholesale power prices and investor jitters over the troubles of energy trading firm enron corp  weighed on the utility sector 
akron  ohio  based firstenergy will use proceeds for corporate purposes and to help pay for its recent purchase of morristown  new jersey  based gpu inc   firstenergy purchased gpu for about     billion in cash and stock  plus the assumption of about     billion in debt  the sale closed on tuesday 
utility bonds are typically viewed as a conservative investments because of the industry  s stable income during uncertain economic times  the sector has been under a cloud  though  as houston  based enron has struggled with a cash squeeze and writedowns from off  balance  sheet transactions 
 enron was held up as a model  growing extremely quickly  and the recent financial disclosures are just a shock   said kelly perl  a project director at new york utility consulting firm applied economic research 
spreads  or the yield gaps between utility bonds and u  s  treasuries  have widened about    to    percentage point over the past two weeks  while spreads on gas and pipeline companies have widened about    percentage points  strategists said 
sale terms
firstenergy sold   billion of    percent five  year notes at    cents on the dollar  yielding    percent or    percentage points more than similar  maturity u  s  treasuries  it also sold     billion of    percent   year notes at    cents on the dollar  yielding    percent or    percentage points more than treasuries  and     billion of    percent   year bonds  yielding    percent or    percentage points more than the old long treasury bond 
initial price guidance had called for spreads as high as        and    percentage points more than treasuries for the five     and   year debt 
firstenergy  s sale was helped by a    percentage point interest rate cut by the u  s  federal reserve on tuesday and signs that the fed could cut rates again 
 there is the perception that the fed is going to aggressively ease and err on the side of caution   said peter palfrey  portfolio manager for loomis sayles  co  in boston  investors are betting that the fed will engineer an economic recovery  helping corporate profits and spurring price gains in corporate bonds  palfrey said 
analysts said firstenergy  s acquisition of gpu should benefit its credit quality 
 it adds further diversity to their cash flow from regulated distribution companies   said fitch analyst robert hornick 
falling wholesale power prices also should benefit firstenergy  hornick said 
 they  re not a big seller of wholesale energy at this point   hornick said   they don  t own generation facilities and need to buy  electricity  in the market  so to the extent wholesale prices are lower  they can benefit   he said 
standard  poor  s rates firstenergy  s senior unsecured notes  bbb  minus   its lowest investment grade  moody  s investors service rates firstenergy  s long  term debt  baa    roughly one notch higher  while fitch rates them  bbb

usa  wrapup   enron  dynegy confirm possible merger talks

 c  reuters limited  
houston  nov   reuters   enron corp   plagued by investor doubts and under the gun to shore up its crumbling finances  said on thursday it was talking with power trading rival dynegy inc  about a possible merger 
the company  whose stock and credit ratings have plummeted amid an uproar about questionable business transactions  admitted it made bookkeeping errors and restated earnings for the last four years 
it also said former chief financial officer andrew fastow  who abruptly left the company last month  had made   million managing partnerships linked to the deals  the deals  which were off the balance sheet  are now under investigation by the u  s  securities and exchange commission for possible conflict of interest 
two other executives  managing director and treasurer ben glisan and enron division general counsel kristina mordaunt  were both believed to have links to the fastow  led partnerships and have been fired  the company disclosed 
the announcements threw a spotlight on enron  s stark situation  in which the nation  s top energy trader has gone from wall street darling to pariah in a few weeks and now faces a cash crunch so dire it is seeking a merger with the much  smaller dynegy 
its credit ratings have fallen to near  junk levels in recent weeks  making it difficult to get money to boost investor confidence and back the trading operations that provide  percent of enron  s income  the company reportedly has been seeking investors to provide a cash infusion for an equity stake 
moderate premium
word about a possible dynegy  enron deal leaked out on wednesday  and on thursday the two companies confirmed talks about a possible  business combination  were underway  but said no agreement had been reached 
sources told reuters that the two texas rivals  whose headquarters are a few blocks apart in downtown houston  were talking about a stock swap with a moderate premium for shareholders and a     billion capital infusion from chevrontexaco corp   which owns    percent of dynegy 
the stock swap is valued at about   billion  or about   a share  the new york times reported on thursday 
a merger would catapult dynegy to the top of the energy trading industry now dominated by enron  last year  the company had   billion in revenues  compared to   billion for enron 
for enron  it would cap an astonishingly rapid fall from grace 
enron stock has lost   billion in market value since its crisis began in mid  october and was down another  cents to     in thursday trading  dynegy shares rose     to     
enron restated its earnings going back to   saying its auditors advised that the off  the  balance sheet deals in question should have been included in the company  s financial statements 
the restated results reduced enron  s net income by   million  or  percent  from  to   and increased its debt by   million  or  percent  after two of the partnership  s financial statements were consolidated into enron  s earnings 
enron said the restatement reflects a     billion reduction to shareholders  equity that touched off the current controversy when the company offhandedly disclosed it last month  angry shareholders suddenly worried that enron was hiding other liabilities in its complex financial statements and began demanding more information 
in a statement  enron chief executive ken lay said the company hoped it had allayed wall street fears with thursday  s announcements 
 we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters   he said 
analysts  wary after last month  s surprise revelations  said enron may have more to release  but they were pleased it was finally coming forth with information 
 it  s an attempt to come clean   said raymond moore  an analyst with weatherly securities

 repeating to show in headline  lead that enron is trading lower 
new york  afx   shares of dynergy inc were sharply higher  while enron corp lost ground in midsession trading after the two companies confirmed that they are holding merger talks

enron share price today was hurt after the company announced a restatement of its net income from  to the third quarter of   the revisions were  for the most part  reductions in the bottom  line figure 
the  bln usd tie  up talks  which come at a time when enron is being investigated by the us securities and exchange commission and the markets are losing faith in the energy trader  are seen as particularly positive for dynergy 
analysts see a tie  up as highly accretive for dynergy  which is  pct owned by chevrontexaco  with many synergies also possible 
banc of america analyst william maze  who rates dynergy  strong buy   said   if this transaction comes to fruition  we would be aggressive buyers of dynergy given its accretive nature as well as the lifting of enron  s credibility issues that has been plaguing the entire industry  
cibc world markets analyst william hyler  who rates enron  buy   added   the move would also catapult  dynergy  into a leadership role at what could prove near the bottom of the gas  power pricing cycle  
on the other hand  enron  s position would improve as its credibility within the trading world and in the face of its trading counterparties would recover somewhat 
to that end  dynergy would provide a yet unspecified cash injection  believed to be approximately        bln usd  to improve enron  s standing and shore up its finances 
chevrontexaco  which is expected to provide a substantial part of the financing needed for the merger  also stands to gain from the situation as it would retain effective control of the combined company

uk  rivals eye enron  s metals trading business 
by andy blamey
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
london  nov   reuters   u  s  energy trading giant enron corp   whose shares have tumbled amid a regulatory probe and doubts about its ability to raise cash  may lose or offload its metals business  senior industry sources said on thursday 
in the wings are several interested parties looking to snap up the company  s metals customer base 
 there are people out there with the experience and the contacts who see this time as a good opportunity to get into the market   a senior metals market source told reuters on thursday 
such a move for enron  s metals portfolio would involve the acquisition of an existing organisation as a vehicle  the source added 
 we do not comment on rumours   an enron spokeswoman said  declining further comment 
other enron metals assets were also said to be in play  including the henry bath warehousing company  which operates lme  registered warehouses in the uk  the netherlands  singapore and the united states 
major player
houston  based enron became a major player in the metals trade in may last year when it acquired mg plc  a leading independent international metals dealing firm in london  in a deal worth around  million pounds 
the company is a ring  dealing member of the london metal exchange  lme   able to participate in open  outcry floor trade  and is active in screen  based metals trade via its enrononline platform  www  enrononline  com  
the company no longer has a stake in online metals trading platform emetra  www  emetra  com   having sold its holding to other emetra shareholders this summer 
but while enron may be a heavy hitter in the metals sector  base metals trading could hardly be regarded as one of its core businesses 
the company  s third  quarter  results statement shows income before interest  minority interests and taxes  ibit  from  europe and other commodity markets   which includes metals and steel alongside european gas and power  among others  of   million  unchanged from the year  earlier period 
this compares with ibit from enron  s gas and power market  making operations and merchant energy activities in north and south america of   million over the same period 
but the third  quarter figure that has slashed the value of the company  s shares is a     billion write  down of shareholder equity related to off  balance sheet transactions 
on thursday the company said it would restate its earnings for  to  to reflect the transactions  a move which wipes   million of the company  s reported net income from  through the first half of this year 
the company  s stock has dropped by almost  percent since enron released its earnings results on october   falling to nine  year lows amid concerns about the company  s ability to raise cash 
the story added an extra twist on wednesday as news broke that u  s   based energy trading and marketing firm dynegy inc  was in talks to buy out enron 
against this background speculation is rife about the future of the metals operation  fuelled by the company  s decision last month to trim between  and  percent of its metals workforce as part of a wider staff reduction by enron europe 
unlikely to remain intact
any decision by enron or a possible future purchaser to offload its metals operations would be unlikely to see enron metals remain intact  traders said 
 they paid   million for mg  would they get   million for enron metals  i don  t think so   said one 
 why buy the whole concern when you can cherry  pick the best traders and the clients will follow   added another 
an increasing emphasis on screen trading at the expense of personal contacts may already have persuaded some enron clients to jump ship 
 we  ve picked up a fair amount of small and mid  sized trade  type business in europe from people who  ve said  i  m not going to be told just to trade on a screen    said one trader 
another trader said   a lot of this business revolves around who you  ve been trading with and talking to over a period of time  it  s about individuals   he said 
 enron online    should be seen as an  added value  product  not as the only way of trading  customers still want to talk to their broker  and are willing to pay commission for the service   the senior source said 
enron  s financial position could also prompt customers to consider other options  the first trader said 
 as a customer  you want to place your business where there  s financial stability  if a company isn  t financially stable  you  ll move elsewhere  
enron  s trade counterparties are also keeping a close eye on the company  s financial situation  said a trader at one lme brokerage 
 people aren  t particularly concerned about short  term trading  with enron   but when it comes to otc business done outside the clearing market they  re backing off a bit   he said

houston   dow jones   enron corp   ene  said it will restate its financial results from  through the second quarter of   as the embattled energy company and dynegy inc  both confirmed they are in talks on a possible business combination 
in a filing thursday with the securities and exchange commission  enron said its financial and audit reports are unreliable for those periods 
enron said that three  unconsolidated entities should have been included in its consolidated financial statements   based on generally accepted accounting principles  these entities are chewco investments lp  joint energy development investments lp and a wholly owned unit of ljm cayman lp 
enron said it has established a special committee to review all transactions  the committee will specifically review all  economic results  related to transactions between enron and ljm 
last month enron took a     billion charge in the third quarter related to write  downs of investments  of this    million was attributed to partnerships run until recently by chief financial officer andrew fastow  who has since been replaced  enron also disclosed it shrank shareholder equity by     billion  as a result of several transactions including ones undertaken with fastow  s investment vehicle 
later  enron said the sec would investigate the company  s  related party transactions   including those with the fastow partnerships 
the restatement will reflect the     billion reduction in shareholders  equity  as well as various income  statement and balance  sheet adjustments determined by enron and its auditors 
 we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters   said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay
over the past couple of days  enron has been scrambling to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private  equity firms and power  trading companies 
earlier  the wall street journal reported that dynegy was trying to buy enron for   billion to   billion in stock  both are houston  based energy  trading and power companies 
because any combination of the two would likely be scrutinized for many months  and enron needs to shore up its finances now  dynegy reportedly is expected to inject     billion into enron immediately  people familiar with the matter said 
chevrontexaco corp   cvx   which owns a   stake in dynegy  is expected to provide dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations  the journal said 
the boards of dynegy  chevron and enron reportedly met wednesday to discuss a potential deal  enron  s stock has plunged since oct    when the company posted a   million third  quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced 
the talks between enron and dynegy follow a sharp decline in enron  s stock over the past several weeks

new york  ap   beleaguered energy trading giant enron corp  announced thursday it would restate its earnings since   in part to reflect a controversial dlrs    billion reduction in shareholder equity that has sparked a securities and exchange commission investigation 
enron  whose stock price has fallen roughly  percent in the past three weeks  also said it was holding talks with dynegy inc  relating to some form of business transaction  the new york times reported that dynegy was considering buying enron  its larger hometown rival for dlrs  billion 
in a filing with the sec  enron said financial statements from  through the first half of   should not be relied upon  and that partnerships run by enron officials during that period should have been consolidated into the financial results of the houston  based energy trading giant 
these partnerships are chewco investments l  p   joint energy development investments l  p   and a wholly owned unit of ljm cayman l  p 
 we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters   said kenneth lay  enron  s chairman and chief executive 
by its own assessment  enron  s restatement reduces previously reported net income by roughly dlrs  million and increases its debt by dlrs    billion  the change reflects the financial impact of retroactively consolidating the partnerships 
the company also fired two executives on thursday  ben glisan  its treasurer  and kristina mordaunt  general counsel for one of its divisions  previously  enron had ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow  who was in charge of some of the partnerships 
shares of enron were off  cents to dlrs    in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange 
enron said it believes the restatement will include a reduction to net income of about dlrs  million in   dlrs  million in   dlrs  million in  and dlrs  million in   increases of dlrs  million for the first quarter of  and dlrs  million for the second quarter and a reduction of dlrs  million for the third quarter of  
enron  the top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the united states  had become one of the nation  s  largest companies  recording revenue of dlrs    billion in  
but the company has been beset by huge investment losses and questions about its financial stability  in particular  its stock has plunged since oct    when the company posted a dlrs  million third quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced 
enron  s woes have prompted considerable speculation about a possible takeover of the company 
besides dynegy  companies mentioned as possible suitors included general electric  s ge capital unit and royal dutch  shell group 
on thursday  both dynegy and enron released statements confirming they were in talks  but declined to provide any details 
the new york times reported earlier that dynegy is considering paying about dlrs  billion in stock  or roughly dlrs  per share 
under the terms of the deal  enron would receive an immediate dlrs    billion cash infusion from oil giant chevron texaco  which holds a  percent stake in dynegy  the times said  citing executives close to the discusssion 
chevron texaco would provide an additional dlrs  billion injection at a later date  the times reported  while dynegy would assume dlrs    billion in enron debt  plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleaguered company  s balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its current problems

enron  the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in north america  said the required restatement reflects the surprising  and controversial      billion reduction to shareholders  equity the company recently disclosed 
the restatement also reflects adjustments to the company  s income statement and balance sheet  now that enron has decided that the financial activities of chewco investments  l  p   joint energy development investments limited partnership  jedi  and a wholly  owned subsidiary of ljml should indeed have been included in the company  s consolidated financial statements

 this story initially ran late wednesday  
los angeles  dow jones    maybe enron corp   ene  is just too big to fail  maybe not 
is the embattled energy trading company important enough to qualify for a federal bailout 
not likely  according to a number of analysts who believe that there are enough big energy companies in the u  s  to keep markets liquid if enron goes under 
for that reason  a federal bailout is probably not in the cards  even though enron controls about   of u  s  natural gas and electricity markets  they added 
 a bailout would only occur if needed to maintain liquidity in the energy markets in order to avoid potential for skyrocketing prices and avoid reliability risks   said merrill lynch       jason  leopold  dowjones  com

restatement
enron restated its earnings for the past four years and the
first three quarters of  to incorporate the first ljm
partnership  as well as chewco investments lp and joint energy
development investments lp  known as jedi 
enron calls them special purpose entities  or spes  they are
vehicles for getting access to capital or hedging risk that can be
moved off the books under some circumstances  enron established
more than  spes 
the company reported that enron and   enron  related
entities   participated in    business relationships   in which
ljml or ljm  participated  they included the sale of asset such as
unused fiber optic cable  the purchase of debt or equity interests
in enron affiliates  and the sale by ljm  of a call and a put
option on some assets 
in addition to chewco and jedi  a wholly owned subsidiary of
lmjl that   engaged in derivative transactions with enron to
permit enron to hedge market risks of an equity investment in
rhythms netconnections  inc     which provides high  speed
networking to businesses 
enron said in the sec filing that those hedging transactions
should have been consolidated into its  and  results
because the ljml subsidiary was inadequately capitalized  enron
did not specify why transactions by chewco and jedi should have
been included on its balance sheet 
enron said it believes that michael j  kopper  a former
company employee  managed a chewco general partner and invested in
it  the company said it also believes that kopper was the
controlling partner of a limited partnership that  through another
limited partnership  in march  purchased interests in
affiliated subsidiaries of ljml   
the company said that it believes the limited partners in
that deal also included glisan  mordaunt  lynn and yaeger  an
  entity associated with   fastow was also a limited partner 
enron said 
enron said that its board approved fastow  s initial
transaction with ljml and put controls in place that required the
review and approval of each transaction by the office of the
chairman  the chief accounting officer and the chief risk officer 
lay and skilling were for many years the only members of the
office of the chairman  after skilling  s resignation in august 
enron promoted greg whalley to president and chief operating
officer and mark frevert to vice chairman  both became members of
the office of the chairman 
lay  as chairman  also had the authority to require fastow to
resign from the partnerships at any time  the board also directed
that its audit and compliance committee conduct annual reviews of
transactions between enron and ljml and ljm  completed during the
previous year  the filing said

debt to junk status  people familiar with the situation said 
enron today restated earnings for more than four years to include

it likely that dynegy could buy enron and pay little or no
premium    said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade  dynegy
  is unlikely to pay significantly more than enron  s current share
price if it does make a bid    he said 
an acquisition of enron would make dynegy the biggest energy

new york  cbs  mw    enron  s troubles deepened thursday as the energy merchant confirmed it  s in merger talks with dynegy and announced  in a securities and exchange commission filing  that it fired two officers and is restating financial results for four years and two quarters 
both dynegy and enron confirmed thursday that they  re in negotiations following a published report that an   billion deal was close to being finalized 
the new york times reported that dynegy  s board approved a stock offer worth   a share for enron 
while confirming the talks  the companies released no further details  dynegy had no additional comment  an enron spokeswoman stonewalled reporters thursday by saying the company was requiring all questions to be submitted in writing  enron did not respond to the questions 
shares of enron  ene  initially rallied but closed at      down  cents  or    percent  while dynegy  dyn  tacked on     to close at     
chevrontexaco  cvx   which owns  percent of dynegy  will contribute     billion to the deal  the times reported  chevrontexaco  which added  cents to close at      declined to comment 
also thursday  enron in an sec filing said it has fired its treasurer  ben glisan  and the general counsel of an enron division  kristina mordaunt  earlier in the month  enron fired chief financial officer andy fastow for his role in limited partnerships that are now under investigation by the sec  enron restated its financial results for the years  through  and the first two quarters of   enron has lost most of its market value over the past month after the sec launched a probe of some transactions by company executives 
enron would bring huge debt
a merger of dynegy and enron would require the smaller company to take on the     billion in debt that  s now on enron  s books  the acquisition would likely lead to the sale of additional enron assets to pay down the debts  the times reported 
boards of both companies were meeting in houston on wednesday night  according to the paper 
 if you look at the balance sheets of dynegy and enron   a merger  would be a tough deal   jeff dietert of simmons  co  he noted that dynegy  dyn  has   billion worth of debt and a market capitalization of     billion 
 enron  s debt load is likely to be too significant for dynegy to step up and swallow   dietert said  for dynegy to make the deal  it would have to issue equity  he added 
it would make more sense for dynegy to consider buying some enron assets  dietert said  that would also help enron clean up its balance sheet 
chris ellinghaus of williams capital group said that chevrontexaco  s involvement would make a dynegy  enron combination more realistic 
 we would view this transaction favorably assuming dynegy intends to dispose of enron  s myriad of non  core businesses   ellinghaus said  dynegy and enron together would dwarf other natural gas and power marketers in the u  s 
ellinghaus said the possibility that dynegy would buy enron is  staggering  
 however  the failure of enron to procure an outside equity infusion has apparently severely limited enron  s options   he said   we do not believe the potential demise of enron invalidates the merchant energy model or suggest deeper problems within the wholesale energy markets  
gregory phelps  vice president and portfolio manager of john hancock  s patriot group of closed  end income funds  said enron  even in its current state  retains some intrinsic value 
 enron still has an incredible number of contractual trading arrangements out there that can  t be allowed to crumble and fall   he added   i think that a firm like dynegy with a firm like chevrontexaco as partner adds the credibility that enron needs  
dynegy gets to buy  assets on the cheap  that it can tie into its own growth  oriented operations  he said
