thanks so much  i will touch base with greg before saturday to provide him
with additional details and logistics 
actually  one of our advisory board members at genesis park  paul hobby 
submitted his name as a nominee  obviously  jeff is one of those leaders
that comes to everyone  s mind when you think of the power of ecommerce and
the internet 
we appreciate your support and will get you copies of photos from the event
as well as press coverage that is received 
best regards 
gary
