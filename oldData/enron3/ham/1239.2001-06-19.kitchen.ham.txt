we are not done  on friday when we were prepared to sign  black hills energy capital said they needed until today to get a signature from their parent  black hills corp  at noon today they said that the signature was on its way  at    pm we heard that they will issue a l  c instead of the corp guarantee  the l  c approach is fine  but i am concerned with this flaky behavior 
our plan is to sign the purchase and sale with black hills energy capital tonight  tomorrow morning  they would have the obligation to deliver either a gurantee or an l  c for   mm by thursday  if not  we can terminate at any time prior to close of business monday  i will update when something changes
