the wall street journal online
stocks rallied sharply monday despite the widening anthrax scare  as a batch of better  than  expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors 
the dow jones industrial average gained     or      to close at    after gaining    points friday  the nasdaq composite index rose     or      to    after climbing    points in the previous session 
other major stock indexes gained ground monday  the standard  poor  s   stock index added    to     the new york stock exchange composite index rose    to     and the russell  index gained    to    
bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened 
the stock market  s gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in washington  d  c   was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation  additionally  two other postal workers in washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment 
but stocks took the anthrax reports in stride  suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants  some analysts said monday   the market is really shrugging off this news   said mark donahoe  a managing director at u  s  bancorp piper jaffray 
upbeat earnings news from american express  released monday afternoon  seemed to give stocks an additional lift 
investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u  s  military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results  said steven kroll sr   managing director at monness  crepsi  hardt 
the uncertainty on the global front  looks like it is going to be a long  drawn  out affair   mr  kroll said   i think stocks will revert back to being earnings  driven  
although dismal by ordinary standards  last week  s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors  who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations   the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings   said mr  donahoe of u  s  bancorp  that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week  he added 
still  investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up  mr  kroll argued 
third  quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday  with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u  s  steel posting results that met or topped analysts  estimates 
the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after  p  m  edt when index component american express reported earnings that  excluding certain items  beat wall street previously lowered estimates 
the financial  services concern posted net income of   million  or  cents a share  down   from   million  or  cents a share  a year earlier  excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september  attacks  american express said it would have earned   million  or  cents a share  for the latest quarter  analysts had been expecting earnings of  cents a share  according to thomson financial  first call 
shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release  closing up     at     
chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher  with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining      the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday  s gains in the sector  sparked by positive earnings news from kla  tencor 
u  s  steel  the nation  s no   steelmaker  said it swung to a third  quarter loss from a profit a year earlier  hurt by oversupply and a weak economy  but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another  u  s  steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial  first call  shares of u  s  steel rose     to     
investors also sent  m shares nearly   higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates  despite a   decline in net income  and oil producers conoco and usx  marathon group handily beat analysts  forecasts 
but not all the earnings news was cheery  local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates  shares of sbc  a component of the dow industrials  fell     to     
meanwhile  the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging  some analysts noted  on monday   m guided wall stret  s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter  and a top executive at u  s  steel told analysts that the company  s fourth quarter would be  difficult  
companies  are meeting third quarter expectations  but they are talking down the fourth quarter   said mr  kroll of monness crespi  hardt  he said that some of the rise in monday  s markets might be a carryover from friday  s buying activity related to the expiration of u  s  stock option and index option contracts  an event known as  double witching  
one of the hardest  hit stocks on monday was enron  an energy concern that said that the securities and exchange commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer  shares of enron plunged   to     
overseas  stocks closed higher  london  s financial times  stock exchange   share index gained      while frankfurt  s xetra dax index rose    earlier in the day  japan  s nikkei  average closed with a gain of      but hong kong  s hang seng index ended     lower 
in economic news  the conference board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell     in september  matching the estimates of economists surveyed by thomson global markets  the index   a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy   included some data gathered after the sept   attacks 
the decline  which was the index  s largest one  month drop since january   confirmed that the widespread weakness in the u  s  economy is deepening  the conference board said  falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the september reading 
in august  the leading  indicators index slipped      less than the previous estimate of a     decline  even so  the back  to  back declines paint a bleak economic picture  said conference board economist ken goldstein 
the two  month decline in the index suggests that the already  weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year  mr  goldstein said  the overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown 
in major u  s  market action 
stocks rose  on the big board  where    billion shares were traded     stocks rose and    fell  on the nasdaq     billion shares changed hands 
bonds were mixed  the   year treasury note rose less than    point monday  or    cents for each     invested  the yield  which moves inversely to its price  fell to      the   year bond fell    point to yield     
the dollar rose  the dollar bought    yen  compared with    yen late friday  the euro traded at    u  s  cents  down from    cents late friday

 c  reuters limited  
new york  oct   reuters   shares of enron corp  slumped more than  percent on monday after it said u  s  regulators are looking into company transactions  another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in august 
a spokesman for north america  s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the u  s  securities exchange commission  but said it was cooperating  the sec also declined to outline details of its inquiry 
investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from the wall street journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by enron  s chief financial officer  andrew fastow  the company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years  and took     billion in charges and writedowns on ill  fated investments 
problems at enron surfaced two months ago when ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months at the helm 
enron shares declined      or  percent  to     in monday afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange  shaving off almost     billion of its market capitalization  the stock  the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the nyse  fell as much as    percent on monday  when it opened at its lowest level since september  
shares declined  percent last week after the journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on wednesday 
enron declined to comment on whether the sec  s inquiry into  certain related party transactions  involved the partnerships 
 related party transactions  is the heading used by enron in its  and  annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships  ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm  co  investment lp  which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars 
fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in june  ljm was set up in june  for energy  related investments  and ljm  in december  for energy  and communication  related investments 
the journal reported   million of its third  quarter loss of   million were connected with the limited partnerships
curt launer  an analyst at credit suisse first boston  said investors should question enron  s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets   most notably in telecommunications   have declined precipitously 
 investors have had several opportunities to question enron  s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined   launer said 
some analysts  though  cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke 
 this is an inquiry  not an investigation  and i cannot imagine enron  s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal   said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey 
 it  s easy for the market to kick a company when its down  but these challenges do not last for a solid company  and we think enron is one

houston  ap   shares of enron corp  plunged more than  percent monday after the energy trading giant said the securities and exchange commission had sought information company  s transactions with limited partnerships  which were managed by an enron senior officer 
in a statement  enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week 
 we welcome this request   enron chairman and chief executive officer kenneth l  lay said in a statement monday   we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest  
investors were upset by the news  however  sending shares of enron down dlrs    to dlrs    in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange 
the transactions took place in  and   according to houston  based enron  s  annual report  they resulted in a dlrs  million pre  tax gain to enron in  and a dlrs  million loss in  
enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships  instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions 
 enron entered into transactions with  limited partnerships  to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets   according to the section in the annual report 
enron spokesman mark palmer said the sec first contacted enron last week and described the request is an  informal inquiry  
 this is not an investigation   he said   we see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us  
sec spokesman john heine said he could not comment on the filings   we can  t confirm or deny that type of activity   heine said 
the electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements  the company  s board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements  and they were disclosed in the company  s sec filings

new york  afx   shares of enron corp were down sharply in late morning trade  after the securities and exchange commission requested the company to provide information on certain related  party transactions  prompting ag edwards to downgrade the stock to  hold  from  buy   dealers said 
at    am  enron was down    usd  or    pct  at     the djia was up    points at       and the s  p  composite index was up    points at      
in a statement this morning  enron confirmed that the sec had requested documents  and said it would  cooperate fully  with the commission 
however  the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the sec  s request 
according to ag edwards analyst mike heim  enron  significantly reduced  its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially  owned subsidiary formerly run by enron  s chief financial officer 
 this arrangement  which was not discussed in past sec filings  has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community 
 in our opinion  the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days 
 however  we can give no assurances that all the problems at enron have been fully disclosed   heim said 
in its statement this morning  enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related  party arrangements  adding that the board was  fully informed of and approved these arrangements   which were disclosed in the company  s sec filings 
 we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done   said chief executive kenneth lay

houston   shares of enron corp  slumped monday after the energy  trading concern said the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about  certain related party transactions   including those between enron and a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer 
enron promised to cooperate fully with the sec request and said in a prepared statement that it  welcomes  the request and looks forward to put  any concern about these transactions to rest  
in  p  m  edt trading on the new york stock exchange  enron  ene  shares fell      or    to     
last week the wall street journal reported that a limited partnership organized by andrew fastow  enron  s chief financial officer  made millions in profits in transactions with the firm  the story cited information reported in an internal partnership document 
enron also said last week it will repurchase up to  million shares that it had issued as part of transactions with ljm  co  investment lp  the limited partnership created by mr  fastow 
in addition  enron took a     billion charge in the third quarter  mostly connected with write  downs of bad investments  producing a loss of   million  or  cents a share  excluding charges  income was   million  or  cents a share  in the quarter 
the charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limited partnerships that were  until recently  by mr  fastow 
the company said the costs connected with the partnerships total   million and involve the early termination of  certain structured finance arrangements  
the partnerships were set up two years ago  and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper  some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for enron  s chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase enron assets  the journal reported 
the energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals  which were disclosed in sec filings 
 we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done   enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said on monday 
separately  an enron shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit in texas court alleging enron  s board breached its fiduciary duties to the company by allowing mr  fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships 
a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said in a prepared statement that enron  s board lost over   million by allowing mr  fastow to run these partnerships  which engaged in transactions with enron and presented a conflict of interest
