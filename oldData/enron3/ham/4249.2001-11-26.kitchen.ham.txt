Subject re  sale of napoleonville land
louise 
on monday  prior to my leaving for buffalo  i spoke with dave gorte and was informed that since the sale of the napoleonville land was greater than     mm  it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a dash 
since the negotiations were quite contentious between reliant  texas brine and enron  we  eva  lisa and myself  had worked with mr  gorte to create multiple versions of the dash  it was not until wednesday afternoon that reliant was the chosen  victor   in addition  since i felt you were apprised of the deal and mr  gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process  lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule 
unfortunately  this meant wednesday afternoon around  pm  but we had been informed by tammi schoppe that you were available until  pm  even though the banks were closed  i had wanted to sign the executables on wednesday so reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend  it was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction 
i will be flying back to houston today and will be landing around  pm  both eva rainer and lisa druzbik are in today and i am leaving instructions to  hopefully  close the deal today  julie gomez will be signing on my behalf   for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to eva  my cell is      
regards  jean

at  pm on wednesday liza arrived with the dash  it had not been circulated prior to that and there was no  one available to discuss the deal as eva was not in the office  please have someone ready to discuss this deal and circulate the dash in advance of when you want it signing 
 pm on wednesday with no briefing on the deal didn  t give enough time to complete a dash

tomorrow  i am flying to buffalo  ny for thanksgiving with my father  as such  for the potential sale of the napoleonville land  julie gomez will sign on my behalf for lrci inc  after both appropriate commercial  accounting and legal parameters have been met  the status is as follows 
texas brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of   mm and has the opportunity to counter  texas brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at     mm 
reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the  act of sale  document  as such  gerald nemec  my legal  is reviewing the document in conjuction with our louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups  i  e  litigation and environmental  
i am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving  however  this bidding  war  has the potential for ena to extract an even higher auction price  the approximate book value of the land is     mm 
i can be reached via blackberry or cell         eva rainer  manager  is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions
