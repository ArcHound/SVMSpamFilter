Subject california update          noon pdt
getting alot of inquiries 
the puc has not yet voted on suspension of da or related matters 
likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next    minutes 
looks as if the decision will   suspend da beginning sept   th and   include contract renewal in the suspension 
in addition  it appears that the proposal would give the commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to july  if deemed necessary  this is unclear and we  re trying to get more details on this provision  
three key senators have sent a a letter to the puc asking the puc to provide recommendations to the legislature on the conditions under which da should be re  instated  since the letter is dated september  th   though sent only yesterday   it appears that the senate had an idea that the puc was going to suspend  
keep in mind that the decision has not been voted on yet and the provisions listed above may change 
we  ll report back as soon as something happens 
for folks who want to listen in  the number is 
    
code  
best
