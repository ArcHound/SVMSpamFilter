  charles yeung has decided to leave the company  he was in the ercot box support doug gilbert  smith 
  i met with ubs counsel today to discuss ferc and other licensing issues  i am scheduled to meet with bob dinerstein  sp   sometime tomorrow to discuss the function and some other administrative issues 
  we continue to gather tariffs  etc  to process the forms as soon as possible  of course  the ability to sell physical power will be contingent upon ferc approval of netco  s mbr authority 
  i have postponed the ferc meeting scheduled for thursday until sometime next week  i still believe that it is appropriate to meet with ferc post  bankruptcy court approval  maybe hsr approval   
thanks 
jim
