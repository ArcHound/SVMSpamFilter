enron australia is barred from trading power futures  updatel 
 adds reason for decision in first paragraph  background
starting in third paragraph 
sydney  nov    bloomberg    enron corp   s australian
finance unit was barred from trading in the nation  s wholesale
electricity futures market because its funding wasn  t assured  the
securities regulator said in a statement faxed to bloomberg 
the australian securities and investments commission today
removed enron australia finance pty from a register of facility
providers for the market 
enron  the largest energy trader  is expected to file for
chapter  protection after the collapse of a planned merger with
dynegy inc  asic said it made its decision because enron  s credit
rating was downgraded 
  enron australia  s last financial report showed that it is
economically dependent on the credit facilities provided  or
guaranteed by its u  s  parent    the statement said 
enron australia had previously indicated to asic it had

enron partnership put   million in company that went bankrupt
houston  nov    bloomberg    enron corp  shares climbed 
percent in  as the energy trader reported profit increases
each quarter  and chief executive kenneth lay predicted   another
excellent year for enron   
lay  s presentation didn  t include a fact that might have
been of interest to shareholders  an enron  affiliated partnership 
joint energy development investments limited partnership  or jedi 
had invested   million in a texas company that went bankrupt 
enron has written off the loss 
jedi was among more than  partnerships enron used to hedge
risks and move assets and liabilities off its books  losses by
some partnerships led to enron  s downfall after the company
reported inflating profits by   million over five years  enron
is on the brink of the largest bankruptcy in history after rival
dynegy inc  abandoned a takeover 
  enron was hiding things and tried to deceive    said rob
plaza  a morningstar inc  analyst who owns no shares    there is
no way the stock would have reached these levels if they had
disclosed more   
legal and accounting experts said enron should have described
jedi  s investment in costilla energy inc   an oil and natural  gas
exploration company  in u  s  securities and exchange commission
filings  that  s because the man who represented jedi in the
investment  tim detmering  is a managing director of enron and
became a member of costilla  s board 
related parties
  it was a related  party transaction    said howard schilit 
president of the center for financial research and analysis  a
group that mines financial statements for accounting red flags 
  a footnote should have mentioned that   
enron spokesman eric thode said the company chose not to
identify the costilla investment or report detmering  s role in sec
filings  he said enron grouped the investment  s loss with other
results  detmering didn  t return phone requests for an interview 
jedi gave costilla   million in return for costilla shares
in late   according to a lawsuit costilla  s bankruptcy trustee
filed against enron on sept   in zapata county  texas 
sherry chandler  a lawyer representing the trustee  said
jedi  detmering and other enron executives pledged to invest  
million from the partnership in costilla to help finance
costilla  s planned   million purchase of oil and natural  gas
properties owned by pioneer natural resources inc 
an enron affiliate  enron oil  gas co   operated the pioneer
properties  the suit says  in september   costilla paid
pioneer   million toward the purchase  which it forfeited when
enron and jedi didn  t invest additional money to close the
transaction  the suit says  costilla then faced a cash crunch and
filed for bankruptcy protection 
 financial spiral 
costilla trustees blame enron and jedi for a   financial
spiral that led to collapse    according to the lawsuit 
louis dreyfus natural gas corp   based in oklahoma city 
bought costilla  s oil and gas properties in june  for about
  million

dynegy  s decision to back out of the   billion acquisition leaves
enron on the verge of bankruptcy 
the houston  based rival of enron must now convince investors

 you see that building over there   an energy trader said  pointing to a nearly complete   story twin across the street from enron  s downtown headquarters   i  m scheduled to move over there next week  and i  m still being told to be ready to move  
unlike top enron executives who continue to portray themselves as in control of the company  s fate  traders said they believe enron  s future likely will lie with a bankruptcy court judge or the committee of creditors that judge will authorize 
others were already working out their grief 
 i got drunk last night   a trader said   you can quote me  i closed  em down  
over the noon hour  as enron employees left work for lunch they passed several reporters and television cameramen  many just held up hands or shook their heads when approached by reporters 
one gas trader from chevrontexaco  s  cvx  houston office  on his lunch break  walked over to a small park across the street from enron  s headquarters  he came to see why all the tv cameras were there 
 sure  i used to call them the evil empire   he said   it  s been a friendly competition  though  they were always willing to make a market  no one will replace them  
he looked up at enron  s headquarters   stories of glass reflecting blue sky and white clouds on a cold  windy day 
 i hate to see them go   the chevrontexaco trader said   it  s like a death in the family

 copyright  c    dow jones  company  inc  
houston   dynegy inc   which terminated its planned acquisition of enron corp  earlier this week  said enron subsidiary northern natural gas can  t take certain actions  including seeking bankruptcy  court protection  without the consent of dynegy as a preferred stockholder 
dynegy  dyn  and chevrontexaco corp   cvx  own all the preferred stock in northern natural gas and control all the voting rights for the pipeline company  dynegy gained rights to the pipeline as collateral for a     billion cash infusion provided by chevrontexaco  which owns about   of dynegy 
dynegy pulled out of its   billion all  stock merger agreement with enron  ene  on wednesday after standard  poor  s cut the beleaguered energy trading company  s debt rating to single  b  minus  essentially rendering it to junk status  both companies are based in houston 
enron is widely expected to file for chapter  bankruptcy protection 
dynegy acquired     billion in preferred stock in northern natural gas in connection with its proposed merger with enron  northern natural  s     mile interstate pipeline extends from the permian basin of texas to the upper midwest 
on nov    dynegy acquired an option to purchase   of northern natural  s equity for about   million  the company exercised that option on wednesday when it terminated its merger agreement with enron  upon closing  slated for dec    dynegy said about   million of northern natural gas debt will remain in place 
 northern natural gas will be an excellent addition to our asset  backed  customer  focused energy delivery network   said dynegy executive vice president and chief financial officer rob doty  in a prepared statement   this network enables us to provide reliable supply  risk management and logistics to our customers  as we have done for the past  years  
mr  doty added that dynegy  has contacted enron to begin a transition of the pipeline  s management and expects enron  s full cooperation  
on thursday  dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson said he was confident dynegy  s attorneys structured the northern natural gas deal so it wouldn  t be affected if enron filed for bankruptcy  once dynegy takes control of the pipeline  enron will have  days to buy it back for     billion plus interest  mr  watson said in a press conference thursday 
dynegy said northern natural gas has been a separate unit for more than  years and operates as a separate business  with separate federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  tariffs  offices  management and customers

norway  interview   bitter days  for enron nordic unit  wants buy  out

 c  reuters limited  
oslo  nov   reuters   the chief power trader at enron nordic energy  a unit of u  s   based enron  said it was heart  breaking to see his unit being pulled down in the maelstrom of its stricken parent company and hoped to find a buyer for his trading operation 
 we hope that someone will buy the nordic unit  and are working on several concrete alternatives in order to make that happen   thor lien  head trader at enron nordic energy  told reuters 
 these are bitter days   he added 
lien said the nordic unit had  employees and was likely the largest player in the nordic power market  holding a    percent market share with an annual turnover of about    terawatt hours of electricity 
 we have done very well  but the actual figures are confidential   he said 
enron nordic energy is part of u  s  based enron and does not belong to the company  s european arm which went into administration on thursday 
earlier on friday the nordic power bourse nord pool said it had closed all positions held by enron nordic energy in its financial market 
 but we have managed to keep all our obligations  and  paradoxically  we are still in business   lien said 
 currently it is the market that owes us money  not the other way round  
lien said the nordic unit seemed cut off from the flow of information as enron  s headquarter in houston prepared for the biggest bankruptcy protection in history 
 it is total silence   he said  adding that enron nordic would have to line up a buyer fast if it were to stand any chance of surviving 
 if the parent company goes bankrupt or files for chapter  there would be no company within the structure that could survive   he said

usa  update   dynegy says enron pipeline cannot file bankruptcy 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
houston  nov   reuters   energy trader dynegy inc  on friday warned enron corp  it cannot try to prevent dynegy  s plans to buy a natural gas pipeline unit of the troubled rival by filing for bankruptcy 
dynegy  which earlier this week backed out of a deal to bail out enron through a   billion takeover  said it bought     billion of preferred stock in northern natural gas  a     mile interstate pipeline company 
 as a result of this purchase  northern natural gas cannot take certain actions  including seeking bankruptcy court protection  without the consent of dynegy as a preferred stockholder   dynegy said in a statement 
dynegy also said despite canceling its proposed purchase of enron  it still has the right to buy all the common stock of northern natural gas and intends to close that transaction on dec   upon closing  about   million of northern natural gas debt will remain  it said 
enron  which is widely expected to seek bankruptcy protection  contests dynegy  s claim 
 dynegy  s right to exercise the option is not dependent on enron  s agreement to our right to terminate the merger   dynegy said 
northern natural gas was formerly part of internorth  which merged with houston natural gas in the mid   s to form enron  and has been a separate unit for more than  years  dynegy said

uk  update   enron says    mw uk teesside station operating 
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
london  nov   reuters   the    megawatt teesside gas  fired power station operated by enron was delivering electricity to the national grid as normal  the company said on friday 
 at present teesside is operating normally   a spokeswoman for the group told reuters 
enron  s european trading business was placed in adminstration on thursday  but this did not include the teesside power station  in which enron has a  percent stake 
britain  s national grid said it would call on other power generators to increase production if it looked like output from the power station might be cut   if there were circumstances where there would not be enough marginal spare capacity we would ask generators to increase output   a spokesman for the national grid told reuters 
 it is standard practice   he said 
the troubled u  s  energy group  which boasted revenue of   billion in   is on the verge of bankruptcy after surprising off  balance sheet disclosures triggered a share price collapse 
the teesside combined cycle gas  fired power station  which came on stream in   is  percent owned by enron with the other  percent split between midlands electricity  northern electric  owned by midamerican energy  the u  s  utility controlled by warren buffett  s berkshire hathaway and western power distribution

uk  update   innogy may buy enron uk assets at  right price  
    
reuters english news service
 c  reuters limited  
london  nov   reuters   british utility innogy said on friday it would consider buying enron  s generation and retail assets in britain if the price were right 
 we would be interested in both enron  s share of the teesside power station and enron direct  a retail arm  at the right price   a spokesman at innogy told reuters 
enron has a  percent share in the    megawatt gas  fired teesside power station in north  east england  an investment which analysts say could be worth about  million pounds 
analysts said the teesside plant might also attract interest from state  owned electricite de france  edf  and dynegy  enron  s former suitor which pulled out of a rescue bid on wednesday  propelling the group towards collapse 
edf said it was too soon comment on the plant  one of the largest gas  fired power stations in europe 
 as with every company  we will look closely but it is too early and nothing has been offered yet   he said 
analysts said teesside  which came on stream in   could be an attractive buy as it has constant income 
 teesside has a fairly steady revenue stream thanks to its power purchase agreement  but that is likely to run out in about  so the station  s prospects after then will be less attractive   an analyst who declined to be named said 
enron direct has about    customers in the small to medium  sized business sector in britain  a market which analysts say shows good revenues and strong margins 
 enron direct is likely to be snapped up   said david kurtz  an analyst at datamonitor  who thought another potential buyer aside from innogy  s retail arm npower would be powergen 
enron  s european trading operations were placed into adminstration on thursday as its u  s  parent tottered on the brink of collapse  but the teesside plant and enron direct were excluded 
 it was the trading operations which were placed into administration because they depended on funds from houston  enron  s u  s  headquarters   but teesside and enron direct  and several other business have their own revenue streams   an enron spokesman said 
analysts expect all enron  s european assets  which include power stations in turkey  italy and poland will be sold 
other european business outside adminstration include enron credit  enron metals  enron wind  and wessex water 
enron credit  the unit which specialised in selling credit insurance to corporates  faces being wound  up with most of the   strong staff leaving the company on friday while britain  s united utilities has already expressed an interest in acquiring wessex water
