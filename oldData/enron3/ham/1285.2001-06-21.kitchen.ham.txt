sales under a  act registration and rule  are  exempt transactions  per the jedi  gkh  hanover stockholders agreement  several months ago i confirmed with ray bowen that there are no other agreements that would restrict our dispositions via a public sale 
prior to actually starting a  process i would advise both gkh and hanover of our plans

dan  although it seems that the secondary offering lockup requirements rule out
the type of transaction discussed this morning  the issue of other restrictions
on jedi right to sell was introduced 
gkh has drag  along and jedi has tag  along rights 
there is an agreement among the company  gkh and jedi that restricts but does
not preclude disposition 
transfers to affiliates are ok
a registered offering or rule  disposition are ok
other sales involve a rofr 
written notice to company  days prior to proposed disposition to bona fide
purchaser
company has  days to respond to buy all or a portion of proposed
disposition on same terms and conditions
if company does not take all shares  any remaining offered to other
shareholder within  days
the other shareholder has  days to respond
these are the primary provisions  we would need a more detailed assessment of
the issue once a specific structure proposed  accepted 
let me know if i can help
