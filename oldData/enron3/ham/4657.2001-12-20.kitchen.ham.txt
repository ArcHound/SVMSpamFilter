subject  getting a deal done
i recognize that we are in a very fluid process right now  however  i feel that i currently don  t possess the information that i would need to make a decision about what structure and compensation would work for me and people on my team in newco  i will attemp to lay out the issues that concern me and provide thoughts on what i have heard about structures so far  excuse me if i am off on any  or all  of my facts  i am currently receiving mostly second  hand information from gas and power traders in houston 
here is the citibank deal as i understand it 
requirement to retain between  and  employees to do the deal 
fund  at some unknown level  a retention pool to be distributed in some unknown manner to an unknown subset of the  newco people 
 employees
  million of   day   var
total  costs of approximately   million 
bonus pool equals   of ebit
bonus paid out   in cash and   in restricted stock with a   year cliff vest 
here are my concerns
the cost structure appears to be well above what a   million var trading operation can support 
my recollection from west power rovar is roughly   in     in   and close to   in  and   i  m not sure how to handicap expected future rovar  but without additional information from the two of you i have a hard time expecting more than   in a lower  priced commodity market  given that assumption  the   million one  day var becomes   million annualized var gives you gross margin of   million  i don  t know what the capital and credit charges will be  for arguments sake let  s call it   million  bonus pool equals                  million of which     is cash and     equity  i can  t sign up for that math  please help me understand how  why my math is wrong 
i need to understand our cost structure in great detail  we need to figure out a way to allocate costs to the desk level  if i look at west power  everyone in portland  assume that we have  people with an average of     for base salary and benefits giving us total personnel costs of   million  add on another   million for rent  parking  travel and entertainment    and call it   million of direct expenses here  i figure that we can make   million in  with lower var and starting up later in the year  how much of the   million remaining costs should i expect to be allocated to the west power desk  with an ebit of   million times   i can sell  if we have another   million of allocated costs then i can sell this 
i recognize that the potential buyer is unlikely to fund a desk by desk ebit  however  i think that our goal should be to split the pie based on a desk by desk ebit and would like to see a proforma that accomplishes that 
proposed retention structure for three people in portland
a dollar amount paid in cash over one year and equity over two years  price tag tbd 
create certainty around the bonus  retention payments 
indemnify against payback of deferred comp 
clarify total retention dollars for the rest of the desk 
  of gross margin for     of ebit going forward 
other gripes
labor has not been invited to the negotiating table 
labor doesn  t get to see the pro forma 
we are supposed to get paid based on ebit yet i have no control over the expense side or the allocation side 
labor is getting accused of holding up a deal that labor had no part in negotiating 
labor is the most important driver of the value of this deal and doesn  t appear to have any rights other than to accept or reject a poorly defined structure 
i want to make this thing work  i am not trying to be greedy  i am finding it very difficult to navigate through this process given the very limited information that i have been given
