Subject re  agenda for ferc meeting re  eol
louise  
we had decided that not having mark in the room gave us the ability to wiggle if questions on cftc vs  ferc regulation arose  as you can imagine  ferc is starting to grapple with the issue that financial trades in energy commodities is regulated under the cea  not the federal power act or the natural gas act
