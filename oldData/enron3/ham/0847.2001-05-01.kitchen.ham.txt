louise 
please find attached the revised hotlist for upstream products and bridgeline  i need to augment the transaction sheet associated with bridgeline  but brian is currently in a meeting  next week  s version will include the strategies associated with the lrc  crawfish assets that are on bridgeline  s balance sheet 
in addition  the storage deal update does not include any of the monetization opportunities of utility pad gas that upstream is targeting  we are meeting with jim steffes tomorrow  paul and i will present our storage strategy on thursday
