 dear john 

 my colleagues and i are working with australian power and energy
 limited  apel  that is developing a   billion synfuel and power plant
 project in the latrobe valley of australia in victoria using brown
 coal 

 the power plant project will be    mw  part of the synfuel
 production will be clean  burning diesel fuel of about    barrels a
 day  worth about       a year at today  s prices  

 apel was wondering whether enron could have an interest in marketing
 the power and  or the diesel fuel  apel also would be open to
 suggestions should enron wish to be involved in other ways 

 the principals apel are in houston this week and could meet with enron
 this thursday afternoon   july 

 john  would or your colleagues like to meet with apel this thursday 
 and if so  what time and where would be convenient 

 thanks and best regards
