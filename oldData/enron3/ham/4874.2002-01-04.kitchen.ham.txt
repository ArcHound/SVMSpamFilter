we have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible  i am working on producing a fuller list for you today  however  there is one particular contract  licence which does require special treatment  power marketing licence to be granted by ferc  in order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future 
our current strategy is as follows  all dates are approximate 
present  january  th   complete filing documentation
january  th visit with ferc  one of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer 
january  th file and request an expedited process
it would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the head of our regulatory group  jim steffes  to co  ordinate with at citi 
thanks
louise
