dear all 
attached is this week  s legislative report 
this entire week has been focused on devising a  solution  for the energy
crisis in addition to negotiating the passage of the state budget  although
the democratic leadership of the assembly and the governor successfully
lobbied four assembly republican lawmakers to switch sides and vote for the
budget on monday  the four republicans have refused to vote for five crucial
 trailer  bills which are necessary to implement the budget bill  there are
approximately  trailer bills that must be passed in addition to the budget
bill  but  have raised concerns for the republicans  sb  transportation
funding shift  sb  elimination of school facility fee housing programs 
sb  omnibus health trailer bill  ab  public social services and sb
 omnibus social services trailer bill  senate president pro tempore john
burton has stated that they will not vote on the budget bill in the senate
until the trailer bills are approved by the assembly  as of    p  m 
tonight  there is no budget deal 
meanwhile  on the energy front  the four proposals we have been discussing
all week   sb  xx  burton   sb  xx  polanco   ab  xx  keeley  and ab
 xx  wright    are still  in play  legislatively this evening  even though
the governor told the dow jones newswire earlier today that the proposals
are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the assembly
and senate to stay in session  despite the scheduled summer break  until a
bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to
him for signature 
 sb  xx  polanco  electric utility rate stabilization act of 
passed out of the full senate on friday with  ayes and  noes  the
originally introduced version of sb  xx reflected the terms of the original
memorandum of understanding   mou   negotiated between governor davis and
southern california edison   edison    it was recently amended to reflect
senator sher  s proposed  plan b  of the mou   a version of the mou opposed
by edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave edison creditworthy 
it was heard in the senate energy  utilities and communications committee on
wednesday where it failed on a  ayes and  noes vote  reconsideration was
granted  however  and the bill passed out of the committee with  ayes and 
noes on thursday morning  the authors took up amendments such as striking
the urgency clause  changing the rate component from  kws to  kws 
placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting section   
 which insulated edison international from certain claims  during the
thursday hearing  sb  xx was then passed out of the senate appropriations
committee on thursday with  ayes and  noes 
 sb  xx  burton  department of water resources  electricity  bond
financing order passed out of the full senate on friday with  ayes and 
noes  making it possible for dwr to issue bonds at a lower  cheaper rate
than allotted in ab lx  keeley  assuming the assembly concurs and the bill
is signed by governor davis  the bill also prohibits any additional charges
such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the legislature and
requires certain  sunshine  provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts
entered to by the dwr  we understand that j  p  morgan and lehman brothers
  the firms working with state treasurer angelides on the bond offering  
have advised the governor  s office that sb  xx could delay the issuance of
the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons  so it is unclear whether
this bill will ever be signed  the bill was heard by the senate energy 
utilities and communications committee on thursday where it passed with a 
ayes and  noes vote  it next must be heard in the assembly 
 ab  xx  keeley  electric utility rate stabilization act of 
passed out of assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday
evening on a  ayes and  noes vote  it was then heard later the same
evening by the assembly appropriations committee  where it was passed on a
 ayes and  noes vote  this is the  compromise  bill we have been
discussing all week authored by speaker hertzberg and assembly member fred
keeley  the bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this
report  with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by
the full assembly  possibly later this evening  the current version of the
bill provides for limited direct access  state purchase of edison  s
transmission lines for     billion  a minimum  percent  haircut  for the
major generators and a  trust  to cover all claims not dealt with by the
haircut option 
 ab  xx  wright  alternative electric utility rate stabilization act
of  was amended into ab  xx  by assembly member bill campbell  in the
assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday evening  and then
passed out of committee with  ayes and  noes  it next must be heard by
the assembly appropriations committee  barring a rule waiver  no such
committee hearing is scheduled at this time  co  authored by assembly
members rod wright  keith richman  joe canciamilla and bill campbell  the
bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address
the net undercollection  among other things 
other energy  related developments this week include 
 sb  xx  burton  state energy resources conservation and development
commission passed out of the full senate on friday with  ayes and  no and
sent to the assembly  this bill provides   million from the state general
fund to the california energy commission   cec   to fund a matching grant
program for a battery backup power source for led traffic signals  the grant
program will be administered by the cec  in consultation with local
governments  and will provide  percent of the cost of the battery backup
system  it next must be heard in the assembly 
 the ferc is expected to consider disbanding the current iso board
for an independent slate of directors on wednesday  the ferc announced on
friday  despite a dec     ferc order requiring the appointment of an
independent governing board for the iso  the state has refused to follow the
order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of
the board  supporters of the ferc order argue that political appointees
should not oversee power markets due to the state  s domineering role in
purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities 
 sb  xx  burton  electrical restructuring  rates passed out of the
full senate on thursday with  ayes and  noes  this bill bars the
california public utilities commission  cpuc  from raising rates back to the
pre   percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate
reduction period has expired on march     it next must be heard in
the assembly 
 the senate gave authorization to the senate select committee to
investigate market manipulation on thursday to subpoena top energy company
executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies 
trading practices  the resolution   sr    passed out with  ayes and 
noes 
 the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation voted
unanimously on wednesday to ask the full senate to find texas  based reliant
energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents 
despite reliant  s having handed over    documents  the committee
rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentiality
of reliant  s documents  the committee stepped back from its contempt vote
last week against enron after the company and committee moved closer to
agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in texas 
mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over
subpoenaed documents  the contempt citation against reliant will be
presented to the full senate  and then immediately sent to the rules
committee for another hearing before the full senate acts  dunn said 
 the state  s estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped
from     billion to     billion after a ferc judge ordered a readjustment
in the state  s figure on wednesday  although the state continues to argue
that the     billion figure is correct  ferc judge curtis wagner called the
figure  baseless  and criticized the california delegation for  not
negotiating in good faith  during the recent settlement discussions  the
new amount      billion  does not include power sales to municipal
utilities and alternative energy suppliers   two entities that do not fall
under the purview of the iso  px or the state dwr   as well as applies ferc
price controls imposed june  and retroactively takes into account sales
from october  onward 
 ab  xx  migden  electrical restructuring  oversight board  iso
passed out of the senate energy  utilities and communications committee on
tuesday to senate appropriations with  ayes and  noes  it was amended by
the author in committee to  double  join  it to sb  xx  see below   this
amendment  ties  the ultimate fate of ab  xx to the fate of ab  xx  unless
the double  joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the
governor for signature  assuming the bill gets to the governor 
 sb  xx  speier  public utilities failed to pass out of the assembly
energy costs and availability committee on tuesday with  ayes and  noes 
reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to
the author  given the failure of sb  xx in committee  ab  xx is
effectively  dead  as well for the moment  see discussion of ab  xx above
