that is great news  we are still pressing the lawyers to see if the enron rep letter can be signed today or in the near future  that way we can issue under the wlb committed lc line 
hopefully once the bank meeting concludes on friday  some of these guys may be more amenable to us using some of the uncommitted lc capacity we have unused at this time

all 
barclays has agreed to accept cash collateral on an ongoing basis until such time we are able to post an l  c subject to the provisions stated below 
under the circumstances  i think that they have been very flexible and would be unlikely to negotiate on most of the points  we would need some clarification on point   onerous if it applies to all contracts under the current isda   we would expect   to only apply to so  transactions  written into the so  confirm  
vincent  brent  i would be grateful if you would take at a look at these points  our timeline is to get everything signed by lpm today 
regards
soma
