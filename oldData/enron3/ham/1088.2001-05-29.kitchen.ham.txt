thanks for the prompt response 
i have some concerns about the performance guaranty  the guaranty document covers three specific contracts  referred to as  transaction agreements    but those contracts are not identified in the performance guaranty by contract number  i have reviewed schedule    and think i have identified the three contracts as      and    and i note that all of these contracts are also listed as  newco contracts on schedule     however  the parties to these three contracts as listed in schedule    doesn  t match the designation of the parties in the performance guaranty  obviously the three contracts have  changed hands  on both sides  i  e   seller and buyer  since the performance agreement is an existing obligation of hpl  there must be a set of records that clearly traces and memorializes the changes in the guaranteed obligations  and we must see that set of records before aep can finally determine how to address the performance agreement  obviously aep doesn  t want to create any unnecessary problems with entex as the beneficiary of the guaranty  but i want to be sure that this arrangement doesn  t need some attention in connection with the closing  if you can make the relevant records available i  ll very promptly review them and we can then decide if anything needs to be done before the closing 
thanks for your help 
mike
