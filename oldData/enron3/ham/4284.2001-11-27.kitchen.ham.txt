enron fights to find near  term sellers  but still trading

new york   dow jones   enron corp   ene  continued to struggle tuesday to find willing sellers of near  term gas and power in north america  but the one  time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis  according to market sources 
 it  s not getting any better   said one major energy broker 
many energy trading companies aren  t selling to enron and are only buying from it near  term  these include aquila inc   ila   mirant  mir   royal dutch  shell group  rd  subsidiary coral energy  sempra energy  sre   and morgan stanley dean witter  s energy trading subsidiary  said the broker  the broker estimated enron  s over  the  counter trading volume to be about   of what it was a month ago  companies are willing to buy from enron in the spot gas and power markets  because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer 
some other companies  like dynegy inc   dyn   duke energy corp   duk  and bp plc   bp   continue to trade with enron fairly freely  the broker said  dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire enron  though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated  the trading subsidiaries of troubled california utility  holding companies pg  e corp   pcg  and edison international  eix  also are trading with enron 
the third and largest group of companies are trading with enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off  setting trades against deals done long ago  these include el paso corp   epg   reliant resources  rri   tractebel sa  s  b  trb  u  s  trading unit and regulated utilities  the broker said 
several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than enron was offering 
 they  ve been cut off from so many people   said one electricity trader 
enron says just slight reduction in transactions
an enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to   of the one  month  ago level 
the notional value of enron  s   day rolling average of transactions is     billion  said enron spokesman eric thode  thode declined to give volume data for tuesday or monday  although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago 
 we  re not doing daily information  we  re only speaking in terms of   day rolling averages     it  s not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility   thode said 
traders and brokers said they hope dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to enron  s trading to restore confidence  but  after enron  s ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse nov    dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed 
energy companies began shying away from enron over the past month  as concerns about its finances precipitated a   drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk  rated debt 
but enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the u  s  securities exchange commission  for the first time since enron  s troubles began a month ago  energy companies stopped selling to enron in the spot markets for fear that enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing

houston  nov   reuters   energy trader dynegy inc  confirmed on tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival enron corp  over their proposed merger  as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some  percent 
 i can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal   dynegy spokesman john sousa told reuters  he declined to give further details 
dynegy had planned to buy its houston rival for   billion in stock and is currently in a  due diligence  examination of enron  s complex financial books that began before the thanksgiving holiday last thursday 
the buyout offer  finalized nov    would have had dynegy paying about     for each share of enron  but enron  s shares have since cratered to near    stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned  if at all 
the stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of    of each dynegy share for each enron share to around    instead  sources familiar with the matter told reuters  enron is willing to accept the lower valuation  given the pressure on its stock price  the sources said 
enron  s shares bounced on dynegy  s confirmation of the restructuring talks  trading up  cents at     in late afternoon action on the new york stock exchange  the shares had dipped as low as     in late  morning dealings and as high      dynegy  s shares gained    percent or     to move to     on the nyse 
also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of enron  s debt past the close of the merger  expected in the third quarter of   the sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least   million in cash  which enron has said it was seeking 
there also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the northern natural gas pipeline  which would be dynegy  s consolation prize if the deal fell apart  a source said  published reports have said that investment banks j  p  morgan and salomon smith barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans  and may dispute dynegy  s ownership if the deal breaks up 
 the pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized  there  s a solid earnings stream from that thing   said one source familiar with the discussions 
one trading unit shut down
two sources confirmed to reuters that enron  s equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly  employees there are being laid off  enron was not immediately available for comment 
those layoffs  part of broader job cuts expected as part of the dynegy buyout  point to an acute problem for enron  the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise  enron  s trading partners have been cutting back transactions with north america  s largest energy trader because of credit concerns 
 this business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth  it is the principal reason that dynegy is making the deal  if it  s worth a lot less then enron is worth less  it  s vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business   said commerzbank analyst andre meade 
but as enron  s stock continued to lose value  down over  percent since dynegy  s initial bid  it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well  enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around   billion  from   billion at the start of    additional reporting by jeff goldfarb  janet mcgurty and jonathan stempel in new york

new york  afx   shares of enron corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with dynegy inc  by cutting the price of the all  stock transaction to  bln usd  or  pct  from  bln usd  dealers said 
at    pm  amid broad declines in the market  enron shares were trading up  cents at    usd  dynegy was up    usd  or    pct  at    
the djia was down    points at       the s  p  was down    points at       the nasdaq composite was down    points at      
earlier  the wall street journal said enron was in advanced talks with dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week  old acquisition deal  the companies are discussing a new price for the all  paper deal  following the sharp fall in enron  s share price of the past few weeks 
enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors   the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of    usd 
as of today  however  the revised deal still has not been formalised 
the current agreement with dynegy contains a  material adverse change  clause  which could be invoked to call the deal off 
as part of its due diligence  dynegy is examining details of enron  s filing with the securities and exchange commission last week  which reportedly contained information it had not received previously 
 enron is a black hole  and i don  t know how deep the bottom is   said fadel gheit an analyst at fahnestock  co 
only four weeks ago  enron  s stock was trading at the  usd mark  gheit said  noting that if the dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse 
 the market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure  it could be several billion dollars   said gheit 
if the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock  exchange ratio  said gheit  under the current acquisition agreement  dynegy would exchange    share for each enron share tendered 
according to the wall street journal  the new ratio is expected to be less than    share of dynegy stock for every share of enron stock  which would value enron at less than  usd a share  or about  bln usd

a dow jones newswires column
new york   dow jones   news that enron corp   ene  and would  be suitor and savior dynegy inc   dyn  are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about enron  s fate 
and so far  even professional arbitrageurs  who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through  continue for the most part to stay clear of enron  s stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader 
still  reports that the equity swap ratio offered by dynegy could be revised down to below    from     has some hedge funds  often willing to take more risks  looking to place trades on the deal 
 we  re trying to figure out a good play   said a trader at a new york hedge fund 
so far  bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading  somehow hedging a short position on enron  s shares with a long position in some of its bonds 
 people that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it   a hedge fund manager at another fund said  this manager added   we  re still trying to evaluate different risk  reward scenario on the debt and equity sides  
investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price 
arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer  while taking long positions in the stock of the target company  but there is nothing typical about enron  s financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by dynegy and large banks like j  p  morgan chase       dow jones newswires

the prospect that enron will fail to line up financing

familiar with the situation  blackstone and questor declined to

enron and dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger
over the weekend  said steve stengel  spokesman for dynegy  dynegy
is now talking about paying less than    share for each of
enron  s  valuing the company  s equity at about   billion  or less
than   per share  the wall street journal reported  citing people
close to the discussions 
terms
  the concern is that the dynegy deal breaks down    said
paul tice  co  head of u  s  high  grade credit research who covers
the energy market for deutsche bank 
current terms call for an exchange ratio of    share of
dynegy stock for each enron share  given recent disclosures about
enron  s debt and the drop in the stock price  a fairer ratio would
be    share of dynegy  said ronald barone  a ubs warburg analyst
who rates dynegy a   strong buy   
under current terms  the deal makes sense for dynegy only if
enron earns  cents or more next year  said gordon howald  an
analyst at credit lyonnais who rates dynegy a   buy    ubs
warburg  s barone has reduced his estimate of enron  s  earnings
to  cents a share from     
enron needs an infusion in part because it has   billion of
payments due before the end of  and less than   billion in
cash and credit lines  the decline in reserves has also raised the
prospect that moody  s investors service may cut enron  s credit
rating  a lower rating would trigger     billion in debt
repayments for two affiliated partnerships 
cash question
  the main question is   what is the cash position right
now     said tice at deutsche bank    is the falloff in the cash
position of the company stabilizing or not   
moody  s hasn  t issued a report on enron since the company
filed a quarterly report with the securities and exchange
commission last week announcing it had a   million note due
this week  on wednesday  enron got a three  week reprieve from
lenders on the   million note and closed on a   million
credit line  dynegy chief executive officer chuck watson said he
was   encouraged   by the developments
