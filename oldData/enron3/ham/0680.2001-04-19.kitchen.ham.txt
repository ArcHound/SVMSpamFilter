Subject fw  tibco  w  k migration
louise 
with regards to the tibco compatability issue     
if you dont want to wait for the windows  migration in mid may  it appears that migrating to tibco    in nt  requires running a migration script that takes about  to  minutes  but there is a risk that there would be some interruption if the migration doesn  t go to plan 
we could go for this friday  and the infrastructure team are already working on modifying a version of the migration script to work on windows nt   in anticipation 
another option would be ask the windows  migration team to switch their roll  out schedule around to pick up the single  deal entry users earlier
please let me know if you are prepared to wait for the windows  roll  out 
regards
steve
