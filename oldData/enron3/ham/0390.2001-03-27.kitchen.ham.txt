our proposal is for ena to assume the nominal cost of the turbine as of jan      exclusive of carrying costs up to that date  from jan  forward we will assume full responsibility for any carrying costs  and any continuing payment obligations under the purchase contract with westinghouse 
the nominal cost of the turbine as of jan     exclusive of carrying costs  is        this is the amount that we propose ena to assume with respect to the turbine 
the carrying cost through jan  to be assumed by calme as part of this proposal is        this amount reflects the actual carrying charges imposed by enron corp on calme based upon the payments made to westinghouse under the purchase agreement 
the continuing payment obligation to be assumed by ena under the purchase contract with westinghouse is        this amount reflects the actual final payment due under the contract  which is due at commercial operations 
please let me know if you need anything else to resolve this  or if you have any questions
