antelope is a project that we acquired last year from aes  the project has land  some early permits  and a transmission queue position that we used at pastoria  total consideration paid to aes was approximately   mm  most of which was charged to pastoria  the resulting cost basis should be about     mm plus the erc  s not used at pastoria  approx    mm   over the next  months we will determine whether we want to pursue the project or  if not  write off the     mm and sell  transfer the erc  s for a gain of     mm  
coyote springs was a project that we developed and sold in   it was a  mw  fa that we co  developed with portland general and sold pre  construction to avista for a   mm promote  there should not be any balance sheet exposure associated with it  we are done
