Subject re  gas daily options revaluation
this is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the gas daily option pricing model  currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts  puts and calls are priced at the same level no matter what the index   the change will result in raising call values  lowering put values at locations with index premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts 
in addition  index plus  minus option deals  for example index     puts   which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option  the index     put is priced flat to the index put   will be accurately priced to reflect the difference in strikes 
if anyone has any questions please call me at    
thank you
