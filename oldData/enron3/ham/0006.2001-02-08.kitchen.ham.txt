executive summary 
utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles  agreement on payback for the bailout  rate increases  and further short  term funding for dwr purchases of power 
disagreement persists between gov  davis and democrats in the legislature on how the state should be paid back for its bailout of the utilities  the split is over a stock warrant plan versus state ownership of utility transmission assets 
the economics of the long  term contracts appear to show that rate hikes are unavoidable because of the need to amortize the undercollected rates of the utilities during the recent rate freeze period 
air quality management district regulations are under review  but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity 
legislature democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left  wing consumer groups and are being forced to at least slow  if not stop  davis  s bailout and rate hike plans  senator burton  s eminent domain threats against generators  which reflect this pressure  are of little significance 
  bankruptcy outlook rising once again
a deal to finalize a debt workout continues to be just beyond the reach of the state  the utilities  and their creditors  with time running out on the debt forbearance arrangement set to expire on tuesday 
socal edison and pg  e are not paying any of their bills except for payroll  they are working very hard to keep cash on  hand  and have indicated that they feel that they are very close to an involuntary bankruptcy filing  once this filing occurs  they will have  days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing or the utilities file a voluntary bankruptcy 
opinion within the assembly is divided with respect to the outlook for bankruptcy  assemblyman keeley told our source that a filing is likely  but that everything will be resolved during that   day period  senator john burton  is in no hurry  to reach a deal with the utilities  as he believes that the state of california is in a good position to  strong  arm  the utilities  burton currently does not intend to cede to the utilities so that they can avoid bankruptcy  the senator stated   bankruptcy would be bad  but not the worst thing possible   he intends to stick to his position  senator burton also dismissed governor davis  end  of  week deadline for striking a deal with the utilities 
still  bankruptcy can be avoided if a last  minute deal can be struck monday on 
what the state receives in return for the bailout
the scope of rate hikes  a federal court is expected to rule on the pg  e  socal v  cpuc rate undercollection case monday 
additional financing is made available to the dwr to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in may 
there is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance  however  the negative tone taken by standard  poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve  the previous forbearance period was only achieved via a high  level washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend 
additional financing for dwr will not be automatically approved by the legislature  the non  energy expenditures of the california government are now at risk  as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the general fund 
  state to take    of utility debt
while the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the   billion debt  a final deal has been held up on two fronts  first  it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt  it is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants and  or transmission assets  a takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets  the value of these assets still has not been settled  second  while the state will be on the hook for   billion  it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout  finally  expect davis and other california politicians to work to minimize rate hikes  although the edison  pg  e v  cpuc case on monday is likely to force their hand here  and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout  the tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants 
no price has been set at which the state would purchase the utilities  transmission assets  which are currently valued at approximately      billion  all of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities  debts  as some of the money would go to existing bondholders  however  ipp sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer 
  long  term contracts
as noted by the governor in his announcement tuesday  only  mw of the    mw of power contracted for can come on  line immediately  much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in long  term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants  some of this will come on  line in approximately two years 
assemblyman keeley expressed frustration that he has received a  tablet from on high  from governor davis that there must not be a rate increase  this means that the state must acquire power  not from internal sources or from the market  but through long  term contracts at    cents  kwh  this allows    cents to amortize socal edison  s undercollection from the recent rate freeze period   the number is slightly different for pg  e   this assumption is based on a natural gas price of     in  and     in   and an efficiency heating rate of        in  and    in  
these numbers were quoted to industry sources  who felt they were unrealistic  these sources quoted the  price of natural gas as           the sources agreed with keeley  s number for the  efficiency heating rate  but they felt that    in  was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line 
according to keeley  s numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at   billion rather than   billion  it would take  to  years to amortize all of the utility undercollection  a settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the state can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection  however  since assemblyman keeley  s numbers are unrealistic  a rate increase will be necessary 
  air quality district exemptions
there have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from aqmd  air quality management district  regulations   ab  x  ab  x  ab  x  also  republicans have been asking the governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in san jose that was denied by the local government 
currently there is no contemplation of loosening the aqmd compliance restrictions  the legislature will not allow  dirtier  plants to
come on  line  however  there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern california by moving away from the
use of credits  this apparently drives up the cost of gas  fired power  
  democratic moderates pressured by consumer advocates
the moderate left  sen  burton  the puc  consumer activists  is afraid of harvey rosenfield and his consumers movement  this is not just because of his initiative  more important from their perspective  his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election  thus  democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout 
  eminent domain would have a limited effect
the threats by burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited  they only apply to california suppliers  a
federal order would be needed to seize assets from out  of  state suppliers  there are also canadian suppliers  such as bc hydro  who are essentially untouchable 
  smaller ipps feeling the squeeze
many of the smaller ipps  which account for approximately  mw of production  appear to be within a few days of running out of cash 
ab lx may be amended  possibly sometime this week  to give the smaller producers credit support
