Subject re  prc mtgs  for louise
tammie  sorry it has taken so long to respond  the meeting dates and times have been changing rapidly and i wanted to make certain the information was fairly firm  there are two additional meetings that louise will need to be aware of since she has individuals in power that will be reviewed  she can make the decision on whether she needs to attend either of these meeting  while i believe that the technical meeting should have adequate bu representation  if louise feels strongly that she would like to attend  she should contact jeanie slone x  as soon as possible 
  the ena commercial support prc will be held this thursday  june  beginning at    pm in the cottonwood room at the hyatt 
commercial support specialists  sr specialists and managers will be reviewed 
if you have any questions or scheduling conflicts  please contact jeanie slone at x  
  the technical meeting for ena  egm has been combined w  eeos  the meeting will take two days  the schedule for the meetings is june  and  nd  further information will be forthcoming shortly
