enron  s board was compromised by financial ties  updatel 
 updates sixth paragraph with details on cash crunch  adds
details of how credit ratings were cut  
new york  nov    bloomberg    enron corp  plunged from the
largest energy trader to the verge of bankruptcy under a board of
directors whose independence was undercut by financial ties to
management  according to corporate governance experts 
enron gave seven of its  directors consulting contracts 
sales to their business or donations to their non  profit
institutions  according to company and public records  the
recipients include three members of enron  s audit committee  which
is responsible for financial oversight 
lord john wakeham  for example  a former leader of the
british house of commons  sits on the audit committee  enron gave
him a      a  year consulting contract  john mendelsohn 
president of the md anderson cancer center in houston  is also on
the audit committee  in the last five years enron and its chairman
kenneth lay have donated     to the cancer center 
  to get on a board you have to be  clubbable   but this
looks like collegiality turning to cronyism    said allan
cleveland  counsel to the new hampshire retirement system  an
enron shareholder 
enron  based in houston  texas handled almost a quarter of
all natural gas and electricity trades  during the past seven
weeks  its board has presided over a   billion drop in market
value that began after the company wrote down     billion in
shareholder equity and reported it had overstated earnings by  
million since  
as enron  s shares fell  the company suffered a cash crunch 
it sought an infusion of capital and agreed to be acquired by
dynegy inc   a houston  based rival  that plan collapsed yesterday
as investors balked at investing     billion  prompting dynegy to
withdraw its offer  enron shares closed at  cents 
responsibility
corporate boards are responsible for protecting shareholder
interests by reviewing the work of top executives  to accomplish
that  two  thirds of a board should be   independent   from
management  according to the council of institutional investors 
which represents pension funds 
the council defines an independent director as   a person
whose directorship constitutes his or her only connection to the
corporation   
  consulting contracts  donations to non  profit organizations
linked to directors  this eats away at independence    said ann
yergen  the council  s director of research 
corporate governance standards established by the new york
and nasdaq stock exchanges say all audit committee members should
be independent 
enron board members  including wakeham and mendelsohn 
declined repeated requests for interviews  vance meyer  a company
spokesman  said enron could not immediately respond to questions
regarding the board 
compensation
enron  s board met nine times in  with each member
receiving annual compensation of     in cash and stock  every
member attended at least  percent of the meetings  except ronnie
chan  chief executive of the hang lung group  a hong kong
development business  according to company filings 
based on enron proxy statements and other documents  the
following relationships existed between enron and board members 
  herbert s  winokur jr     is the managing partner of
capricorn investors l  p   a holding company that owns the natco
group inc   a maker of oil and gas production equipment  an enron
board member since   winokur serves on the executive
committee  chairs the finance committee and was appointed to a
special committee created to look into how enron was managed 
in   natco had     in sales to enron subsidiaries 
or about    percent of natco  s total sales 
 compromising 
  we think that anything over  percent is compromising   
said yergen of the council of institutional investors 
enron said in a proxy statement it believes the terms of the
sales were   no less favorable than the terms of similar
arrangements with third parties   
  robert a  belfer    has been on the board since  and
sits on the executive committee  he is enron  s largest individual
shareholder with    million shares  and is chairman and chief
executive of belco oil  gas corp   which operates from an office
overlooking new york  s central park  in   belco had  
million in trade settlements and   million in option premiums
with enron trade resources corp   an enron subsidiary 
  john urquhart    a former general electric co  executive 
sat on the board until last may  he received an annual consulting
fee from enron of almost     a year as a special adviser to
the enron chairman 
  mendelsohn    is a physician who was formerly head of
medicine at memorial sloan  kettering cancer center in new york  he
pioneered research in controlling cancer through the chemistry of

enron pays wakeham     a month to advise the company on
european business 
enron  s audit committee poses particular problems  according
to corporate governance experts  the committee is composed of
wakeham  mendelsohn  gramm  chan  robert jaedicke  a retired
stanford university business school dean  and paulo ferraz
pereira  a brazilian banker 
wakeham  gramm and mendelsohn are not independent  according
to corporate governance experts and standards 
  for the audit committee  you don  t even want the appearance
of a conflict    said charles drott  a forensic accountant who has
testified as an expert witness in bankruptcy and business fraud
cases involving companies such as delorean motor co  and lincoln
savings and loan association 
the committee is spread across the globe  with wakeham in
london  ferraz in rio de janeiro and chan in hong kong 
  the question is why this committee    drott asked    for a
big sophisticated company like enron  why did they choose these
people   
swift descent
enron  s rapid decline   standard  poor  s corp  slashed its
credit rating eight levels this month to junk status   centered
on its dealings with partnerships the company used to move assets
and debt off the company  s books  many investors had complained
enron  s financial reports obscured the partnerships  businesses to
the point they were impossible to understand  enron  s former chief
financial officer andrew fastow led some of the partnerships and
earned more than   million through their dealings with enron 
the company disclosed 
enron documents filed with the u  s  securities and exchange
commission state that the board determined that fastow  s
participation in the partnerships would   not adversely affect the
interests of enron    the documents also say the board approved
all transactions involving partnerships that were brought to it by
lay and other enron executives

india  s dabhol power co   one of enron  s biggest asian gas
and power units  has been mired in accusations of bribery and
exorbitant power tariffs 
  lenders will have to take control of the project    said
madhav godbole  who headed a panel set up to resolve a payment
dispute between dabhol power  enron  s india unit  and the
maharashtra state electricity board  its sole customer    buyers
 for dabhol  will have to negotiate with the lenders   
enron  which is owed   million for bills that are more than
 months overdue  wants   billion for its  percent stake in
dabhol as it exits india  tata power ltd  and bses ltd   the two
bidders for enron  s stake  have said the price is too high  both
supply power to mumbai  india  s commercial capital 
the industrial development bank of india  the country  s
biggest lender  and the state bank of india are among local
lenders that loaned     billion to dabhol  they have the most at
stake if the loans turn bad  the   million lent by abn amro 
bank of america corp  and other overseas banks is covered by
government guarantees  while indian bank loans are not 
cancellation notice
enron on may  issued a six  month notice canceling power
sales to the electricity board  the deadline lapsed on nov   as
the mumbai high court early this month stopped dabhol from serving
the final termination notice until dec   
the court  s move was in response to a suit filed by indian
lenders against dabhol to prevent it from canceling the contract 
they were concerned the loss  making electricity board will be
forced to buy the power plant  making loan recovery difficult 
  the matter has become extremely interesting  for india  in
the context of dynegy pulling out    idbi chairman p  p  vora told
reporters at the lenders  earnings meet    i can  t say more as the
matter is in the court   
idbi alone has lent dabhol   million 
indian lenders won  t attend a dabhol board meeting or a
summit of creditors  both of which are to be held in london
tomorrow  vora said  without giving any reason  dabhol  s board is
meeting to authorize k  wade cline  managing director  to serve
the termination notice 
discount 
enron  s stake in dabhol may now be worth much less than the
  billion it is seeking  still  potential buyers may find it hard
to raise the money they will need to finish work on the plant 
construction contractors in june stopped work on expansion of
the power plant because they hadn  t been paid since april  the
expansion  which was to add    megawatts of capacity to the
existing  megawatt capacity  and a  million  tons  a  year
liquefied natural gas receiving terminal  is  percent complete 
  buyers may get a good price but they need   million to
complete the project    said pradyumna kaul  an activist who  s
campaigned against dabhol for eight years    that is a lot of
money for a project that  s in distress and whose credibility is at
its lowest   with enron on the verge of collapse 
awaiting  response 
bses managing director r  v  shahi said he  s waiting for a
  response   from the lenders on the future course of action 
  they came to us with  the project  and our action will
depend on what their approach is    bses hasn  t set a price it
would pay for the project  shahi said    we  ve not reached that
stage yet   
tata power officials weren  t available for comment 
  the equity value  of enron  will go down  helping potential
buyers  but that does not solve the basic problem  that of high 
cost power    godbole said    all parties linked with the project
will have to make sacrifices   to reduce the cost of power 
dabhol  s power charges in  rose as high as    rupees  or
 u  s  cents  a kilowatt  hour  compared with other suppliers 
rates of about    rupees  that led the electricity board to
default on bills  and in may it stopped buying power from dabhol 
saying it was too expensive 
enron was one of the first major companies to enter india
after the country  s economy opened up to foreign investment in
  it was awarded the contract to build the power plant 
miles south of mumbai without competitive bidding 
plant construction was delayed for about two years after
public interest groups filed lawsuits against the project  on the
grounds its power was too expensive 
a state government reworked the contract just five months
after scrapping it  a move that sparked accusations of the company
bribing politicians in return for the contract   a charge denied
by all parties

washington  nov    bloomberg    enron corp  may file for
bankruptcy protection in the biggest chapter  reorganization in
history  forcing the largest u  s  energy trader to liquidate
billions of dollars in assets to pay creditors 
dynegy inc  yesterday abandoned its proposed merger with
enron  leaving the houston  based company burdened with debt and
the likelihood of insolvency  some analysts said bankruptcy is
inevitable and may come as early as today  a bankruptcy filing by
enron  which reported more than   billion in assets  would top
texaco inc   s record     billion case filed in  
under chapter  protection  enron officials could continue
to control the company while negotiating a recovery plan with
creditors  an   automatic stay   under u  s  bankruptcy law would
block debt  collection efforts  lawsuits and other actions against
the company 
  a chapter  filing can be a great thing for a cash  starved
company being attacked from all sides    said nancy rapoport  dean
of the university of houston law center 
an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people
including the company  s    employees  its customers 
suppliers  investors and other creditors  the court  supervised
recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies
and fix mistakes  it might take years to complete and may end in
the company  s liquidation 
in addition to its energy trading operation  enron operates a
nationwide gas pipeline system spanning    miles  it also owns
portland general electric  which generates and distributes power
to about    customers in the pacific northwest  the company  s
enron broadband services is building a global fiber  optic
communications network 
 witches brew 
chapter  reorganization lets companies abandon onerous
contracts and unprofitable leases 
  every bad business deal enron got into they  ll walk away
from    said peter chapman  a distressed  debt investor who also
publishes newsletters on high  profile bankruptcy reorganizations 
the goal in chapter  is a recovery plan that allows a
company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy  a plan
typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing
two  thirds of a company  s debts  then a company would ask a
bankruptcy judge for final approval 
the recovery plan divides a company  s value among various
classes of creditors  under a hierarchy set by the u  s  bankruptcy
code  secured creditors   those with collateral backing their
claims   are paid ahead of unsecured creditors  such as
bondholders and suppliers 
financial advisers to creditors and companies in large
bankruptcies say a chapter  recovery plan for enron would be
particularly difficult to produce 
  you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass
of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches  brew of a
bankruptcy    said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard 
zukin  an investment banking firm that has been contacted for
advice by enron bondholders 
enron  s shareholders are likely to lose all of their
investment in a chapter  case because they would be last in line
to get paid 
shares  the most active in pre  market trading on instinet 
gained  cents to  cents after plunging  percent yesterday 
the company  s    percent notes that mature in  were unchanged
at about  cents on the dollar  traders said  at that price the
notes yield  percent 
enron said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay
a declared dividend  the company is scheduled to pay a     cent
quarter dividend on dec  
 black hole 
for investors now considering buying enron  s bonds and other
debts  a major issue is the uncertainty surrounding the company  s
value 
  until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort
things out you just don  t know what enron  s worth    said gary
hindes  managing director of deltec asset management llc    it  s a
black hole    deltec has no investment in enron  hindes said 
enron  s bond prices reflect the uncertainty  the company  s
   percent bonds  which mature in   were quoted at  cents
on the dollar  down from  cents tuesday 
some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may
come from lawsuits  said russell a  belinsky  an investment banker
with chanin capital partners  which also has been approached for
advice by enron bondholders 
  there  s a lot of juicy legal issues    said belinsky 
potential targets include enron  s accounting firm and its officers
and directors  he said 
liability
dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase
of enron  dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave
it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the
takeover fell apart  dynegy received the right to the pipeline in
exchange for a     billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco
corp   which owns one  fourth of dynegy 
enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking
away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline 
the dynegy acquisition  valued at   billion when it was
proposed on nov    collapsed as bankers failed to raise the    
billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed  the
lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy  s
decision 
bankers led by j  p  morgan chase  co  vice chairman james b 
lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed  investors
turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn  t be
able to pay its debts 
three credit  rating agencies yesterday cut enron  s credit
rating to junk status  triggering an acceleration of the company  s
debt obligations 
unraveling
enron  s unraveling began in october after it said
shareholders  equity was reduced by     billion because of the
way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created  the
announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u  s 
securities and exchange commission  and enron ended up restating
earnings for almost five years 
as shares plunged  enron  s trading partners lost confidence
the company would have the cash to pay bills  trading partners
such as mirant corp  either demanded more collateral to trade or
restricted trading with the company 
  the situation is dire    said deltec  s hindes    no one  s
going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up
being an unsecured creditor tomorrow

enron  s collapse evokes memories of old  time bank run  nyt says
         new york 
houston  nov    bloomberg    enron corp  was successful
because the energy trading operation it created was largely an
unregulated financial business and became something like a bank 
which took depositors  money and promised to pay it back  floyd
norris wrote in his column in the new york times 
when negotiations on dynegy inc   s revised takeover came down
to efforts to find   million or   million of enron assets
that could serve as collateral for a new dynegy cash advance  it
became clear that even enron  s rescuer was demanding collateral
and having trouble finding it  the times reported 
unlike banks  enron had no federal deposit insurance to
reassure customers when rumors spread that it was in trouble  the
paper reported  enron  s collapse is a reminder for participants in
unregulated markets that their financial health must be beyond
doubt 
unregulated markets can be very profitable for those with
market knowledge  as enron seemed to have  yet  when prices are
visible to all  the value of that knowledge falls  new regulation
can bring more openness  though it also can bring structures  like
clearing systems that reassure traders they need to worry about
the credit of those with whom they trade  the paper said
