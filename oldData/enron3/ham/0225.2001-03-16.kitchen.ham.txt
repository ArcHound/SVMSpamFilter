today we negotiated a handshake agreement with smith properties to buy out jedi  s position in inland for   million    million net to enron   the dash minimum was     million      net to enron   the original offer  documentation will be simple  our rep is limited to we own it and we can sell it  expect to close and fund next week 
given the inland situation and the absence of any foreseeable payment on our preferred  i view this outcome as very favorable 
brandi morris  work on this transaction was outstanding
