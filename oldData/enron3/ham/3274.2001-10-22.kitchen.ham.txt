subject  just so you know
john arnold asked me this morning about individuals on eol  apparently   john was told that i had a problem with this  i haven  t had a conversation on this since    at that time i sidelined the issue as it was complex  bearing in mind everything else that was going on  i would suggest you and mark address tis together 
i have no idea who told john this as i haven  t had a dizcussion on this issue since
