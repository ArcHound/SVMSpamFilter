attached is a file containing the following information for your management meeting in beaver creek  august       
preliminary agenda
cost estimate
outside speaker options
i am holding  enron aircraft for this event and have included that price in the cost estimate 
i have reviewed all the video tapes for the outside speakers with the exception of the political humorists  the only one that i would not recommend is joe malarkey  i thought his material was  pure malarkey   but that is just my opinion  i have bios if you would like to see them  we are not limited to this list  i can check pricing and availability for anyone that you would like to suggest 
please let me know if you have any questions or comments 
thanks
