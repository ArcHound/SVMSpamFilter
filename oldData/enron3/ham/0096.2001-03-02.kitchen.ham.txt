with respect to your questions concerning the heartland industrial partners fund and current investments 
heartland is a private equity buyout fund with     billion in commitments  the targeted size of the fund is   billion  the fund is headed by david stockman  former managing director at the blackstone group  stockman was director of omb under reagan 
heartland  s objective is an irr of   gross    to the limited partners   the limiteds get an   preferred return after which the gp gets a   carried return  the gp also receives a     management fee  in my experience these terms are consistent with most private equity funds 
the fund  s objective is to acquire and expand industrial companies  in sectors ripe for consolidation and growth   these  industrial platform scaleups  are targeted to be in sectors such as aerospace components and materials  automotive suppliers  capital goods  chemicals  plastics conversion  metal working  etc 
the fund has two investments currently 
mascotech is a merger of three fund companies  it is a leading global designer and supplier of high quality  low  cost metal formed components  assemblies and modules for the transportation industry  products include noise vibration and harshness products  transmission and transfer case components  engine components  wheel end and suspension components  axle driveline components  estimated revenues were     billion in   the company has  facilities in  countries     employees 
an agreement to purchase collins  aikman corporation was signed in january   c  a is a leader in automotive floor and acoustic ceilings and a leading supplier of automotive fabric  interior trim and convertible top systems with  sales of     billion 
the original dash in april  predicated that  ena will receive the exclusive right to provide all energy  related products and services to each platform company owned by the fund    ena will submit a comprehensive  long  term  energy managment plan for each platform company  hip will be obligated to accept and implement the plan as long as the plan provides a cost benefit relative to the platform company  s current practices after accounting for switching costs  the expected value of this business to ena is about     mm

dave 
congrats on your new role  heartland industrial partners was an investment pursued solely for the purpose of providing deal flow for energy outsourcing opportunities when ena  s industrial group was following a broad based energy outsourcing business plan  it has zero relevance to eim  s business  in fact  heartland has been reflected on ena  s balance sheet ever since the creation of eim last august  brad dunn has administered the relationship as a transitional matter in the intervening months  brad has attempted to get ees to take on the transaction  but they have expressed no interest in the capital commitment  however  ees wants the option to look at the energy outsourcing opportunities in the transaction  if i thought i could get a free option  i would take the same position  if enron is to get anything out of heartland industrial partners beyond the return on our invested dollars  that value will come to ees  since there is no paper or steel aspect to heartland  it doesn  t belong in eim and i don  t want it  i would be happy to discuss 
on a different note  there are lots of opportunities for ees and eim to work together on  i  energy opportunities in eim  s pulp colwell  wes  raymond bowen  hou  ect  enron

richard  it is my understanding that this investment is currently in ray bowen  s business  in my ena shoes  i would say we would have no interest in taking on that responsibility  in my ees shoes  i would like to take a closer look at the possible connections  please send me some info on the investment fund and their current investments portfolio 
i have also heard that tom white has been talking to you about ees taking on the catalytica investment  with my ees shoes on  no way

dave  in may  enron north america committed to invest up to   million in heartland industrial partners l  p   a private equity fund  the terms of the fund investment are fairly typical  and not particularly exciting for a limited partner such as we   the deal was  sold  on the basis of ena getting exclusive rights to provide energy management services to companies owned by the fund if these were cost effective  the claimed benefits for the energy management tie were calculated at     million  the deal was originated by brad dunn who now is in eim  ownership of this commitment had been assigned to jim ajello 
the kinds of energy management services associated with this deal are now provided by ees  while they are happy to exploit any opportunity  their business plan does not contemplate investment substantial capital in this kind of deal  in short  they have no interest in picking up the commitment  and capital employed  via an intercompany transfer 
private equity funds such as this are highly illiquid by design and the normal investment cycle is at least    years  the heartland partnership has a   year life  enron did negotiate the right to sell its lp interest after  years  as a practical matter  that right guarantees neither a fair price or even a market 
there is no logical home for this investment that i know of in ena except in my portfolio  question  is this an ena responsibility or would it move to eim  s balance sheet  if we  ena  have no choice but to retain the investment  my group will take responsibility for it and do our best to monetize funds invested to  date  about   million  and sell the remaining commitment  since the fund itself is still marketing limited partnership interests  however  it will be extremely difficult to get out of our investment  commitment in the foreseeable future  under any circumstances finding a buyer will be time  consuming and expensive   this is a poster child for  patient  investment capital  
i want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is that the obligation should be transferred to eim which i believe has assumed the charter of the ena group that formerly managed this investment  dick
