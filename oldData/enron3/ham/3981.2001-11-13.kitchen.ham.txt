Subject allegheny  nepco
the  bid  is for an epc contract with the equipment  the implied bid for the equipment is      mm  the implied margin in the epc contract is   mm plus   mm of contingency  if the risk  reward on the epc contract is reasonable  then this seems like a great deal  at the same time  we will attach a turbine loi to the epc loi making it clear to allegheny that we can offer the turbines on a stand alone basis  should we offer at the   mm discount or are you ok with      mm  ben and i would hit a      mm bid  this would probably close this in january  but we ould try to get a turbine down payment in december
