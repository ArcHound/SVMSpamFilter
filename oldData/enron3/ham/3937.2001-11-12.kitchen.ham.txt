dynegy inc   s proposed      billion  u  s   takeover of enron corp  faces major uncertainties  ranging from possible opposition from regulators to potentially huge new liabilities and writeoffs at enron 
the problem with regulators could come from antitrust worries about folding houston  based enron  the biggest u  s  trader of natural gas and electricity  into dynegy  another major energy trader  also based in houston 
enron currently handles a quarter of all the natural gas and electricity traded in the united states  the combined company   which would be called dynegy inc    would have    megawatts of generating capacity and    kilometres of natural gas pipelines  making it one of the largest companies in the united states in each of those categories 
while enron and dynegy officials said they expect the merger to garner the necessary government approvals  the review by regulators is expected to take months 
as for unpleasant financial surprises  enron has already produced a devastating stream of them over the past month  ranging from huge writeoffs of assets and reductions of shareholder equity to major downward restatements of past earnings reports 
much of this turmoil has been caused by enron  s dealings with private partnerships run by its own officers 
indeed  recent enron disclosures indicate that as much as half of the company  s pretax earnings in recent years came from deals with these officer  related partnerships  raising further questions about the quality of enron  s earnings and the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars of additional writeoffs or restatements 
enron  s partnership dealings have sparked more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits and a formal investigation by the u  s  securities and exchange commission 
in a measure of the continuing concerns over enron  s financial condition  both moody  s investors service and standard  poor  s once again downgraded enron  s debt on friday  this time to just one level above non  investment grade  or  junk  status  they also kept the company under review for possible additional downgrades  and s  p put dynegy on the same status 
a downgrade to junk status could force enron to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars in cash or stock to buttress some of its complicated financial transactions 
in an interview friday  dynegy chairman chuck watson said his company made  a good assessment  of enron  s condition and that in  the worst  case we can come up with    we feel comfortable  that  the value exceeds the liabilities  
mr  watson said dynegy has given itself the opportunity to back out of the proposed merger under certain conditions  which he declined to specify 
a person familiar with the deal said that dynegy has a right to walk away if enron  s additional legal and financial liabilities exceed      billion 
a dynegy spokesman confirmed the figure 
the price being paid      of a dynegy share for each enron share   is a fire  sale deal by any recent historical standard  the transaction valued enron shares at     each  based on dynegy  s price of     friday  up     in new york stock exchange trading  enron shares rose  cents at     in big board trading  a quarter of their price just a month ago and less than a tenth of the all  time high of nearly   a share reached last year 
the deal envisions quickly pumping      billion of cash into enron to bolster its liquidity and comfort enron  s trading partners who are increasingly nervous about continuing their business  the funds will come from chevrontexaco corp   dynegy  s biggest shareholder with a   per  cent stake  dynegy will use the money to purchase the preferred stock and other rights in an enron pipeline subsidiary

watson puts trust in the quiet approach

charles watson set out  years ago with  five guys and a smile  to build what would become dynegy 
that same year  kenneth lay laid the foundations of enron by merging the assets of two established companies  he had an inter  state and intra  state natural gas pipeline company with    miles of pipe 
enron widened its lead over the years  so that last year it reported   bn in revenue  to dynegy  s   bn  it was the number  one seller of natural gas and power in north america and operated the biggest web  based transaction system in the world 
but on friday  the dynegy chief executive brought his company out from enron  s shadow  agreeing to buy its embattled rival in a deal worth about   bn in stock  overnight  dynegy became the biggest energy trader in the us  how did he do it 
where enron emphasised individuality  dynegy stressed teamwork  where enron encouraged entrepreneurship  dynegy stressed customer satisfaction  where enron urged aggression to pervade everything from its trading floors to its financial accountings  dynegy made friendliness and conservatism its culture 
enron had its name emblazoned across houston  s professional baseball stadium and was building an office tower in downtown houston  dynegy was renting  floors out of the wells fargo complex 
enron  mr watson notes  had a reputation for doing business with a swagger   if that  s your modus operandi  when things don  t go well people come after you   mr watson says  he believes that image of cockiness made questions over enron  s balance sheet spiral out of control  the balance sheet adjustment itself could not justify the massive degradation of its equity in a matter of weeks 
 the masses at enron are thirsting for a change in image   mr watson says  he intends to give them that 
mr watson will remain in charge when dynegy takes control of enron in the coming months  he has asked mr lay to join the board  but mr lay has not made a decision   it  s been a good ride  for the most part   mr lay said friday night  but added   i would say the last three weeks have not been a lot of fun  
mr watson reached out to mr lay on october   as the crisis of confidence in enron became increasingly untenable  the securities and exchange commission was investigating its finances  investors were dumping its stock and the credit rating agencies were downgrading its debt 
mr watson  s mother was having heart surgery and he was with her in saint louis 
but he called mr lay to offer to help  in the back of his mind was the possibility of buying enron  s valuable pipeline assets to provide it with liquidity to support its fast diminishing business 
two days later  mr watson went over to mr lay  s home to begin working towards a combination 
in a meeting with mr lay and the rest of enron  s management team  it became clear they were  willing to fix the problem whatever it took  
mr watson believes the deal was put together so quickly because dynegy works with enron on a daily basis  they know each other  s people and businesses  and they are both based in houston 
 we  re one of the few people  maybe the only ones  who could have pulled it off   he says 
now that he has done so  mr watson plans to move into enron  s new buildings  but has not decided whether to rename the stadium to reflect its new owner  his teenager wants him too  but that would seem to go against the modesty that enabled dynegy to win in the end

ratings prove crucial at enron 
by jenny wiggins in new york 
    
financial times
 c   financial times limited  all rights reserved
credit ratings agencies consider themselves independent providers of research and information  but the role played by moody  s investors service in the sale of enron to dynegy last week shows agencies are often more than dispassionate observers 
in enron  s case  its credit ratings were crucial to its survival  the company needed an investment grade credit rating to retain the confidence of its energy trading counterparties 
enron  s solution was to arrange an acquisition by dynegy  but first it received the credit agencies  blessing 
with the two companies close to a deal on friday morning  moody  s responded to investor concerns about the company by downgrading the company  s ratings to just one notch above junk 
however  it also signalled it was prepared to sanction a deal  adding that  a substantial near  term injection of equity capital  would be viewed as  a stabilising event   that arrived in the form of a     bn cash injection from chevrontexaco 
the ratings agency was under pressure to provide a credit outlook  enron generated  a tremendous amount of interest   including calls from market participants  who wanted to share their opinion   said moody  s fran laserson 
moody  s analyst john diaz said that while the agency had analysed enron  s financials both on and off its balance sheet  there were  some issues  the agency had not been aware of 
this means that even as they seek to point out the risks inherent in a company  s balance sheet  they are also looking out for the long  term interest of a company and are willing to give troubled entities some time to deal with problems and get back on their feet

dynegy  s rushed gamble on enron carries some big risks

call it a   billion shotgun wedding 
dynegy inc   an energy marketer and trader based in houston  took the biggest gamble in its corporate history on friday by agreeing to buy the enron corporation  its much larger crosstown rival  for more than   billion in stock  in one decisive move  chuck watson  the chairman of dynegy  positioned his company to become the most important player in the volatile but potentially lucrative business of trading natural gas and electricity 
but the hastily arranged deal carries big risks for dynegy as well  skeptical investors and wall street analysts say  no one outside enron appears to understand the company  s tangled finances fully  and the speed with which the deal was made did not give dynegy time to scrutinize in great detail enron  s trading book or the web of partnerships enron has entered to move debt off its balance sheet and hide losses 
the skeptics wonder why dynegy decided to take on enron  s huge debt  which some analysts say could total   billion in loans on and off its balance sheet  instead of simply trying to hire away enron  s best traders  some of whom were already leaving the company 
  there are many risks associated with this merger that we will not know about for a while    said carol coale  an analyst at prudential securities    we  re not sure that we know everything there is to know at enron yet   
in addition  enron  s earnings could be far lower than it has reported  said james chanos  a short  seller who has been a vocal critic  on thursday  enron said in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that it had used partnerships to overstate its earnings by a total of   million over the last five years  mr  chanos said other information in the filing indicated that more restatements were possible 
with so much uncertainty surrounding enron  s finances  mr  chanos and other analysts question dynegy  s decision to move so quickly 
they note that dynegy and enron often traded with each other  and some analysts had wondered whether  if enron had filed for bankruptcy  those trades might be wiped out  leaving dynegy unhedged  or unprotected against sudden movements in the prices of natural gas or electricity 
if  on the other hand  enron is not forced to restate its profits down further  then dynegy has clinched an amazing bargain  analysts say enron will make     a share this year  so dynegy is paying just six times enron  s annual earnings  about a fourth the average ratio of companies in the standard  poor  s  
dynegy said on friday that the deal should increase its per  share earnings next year by  to  cents  to     to      even without factoring in up to a half  billion dollars in annual savings  before taxes  from the merger  dynegy  s shares closed friday at      up      so if the company  s forecast is accurate  it is trading at  times its  earnings   still a bargain compared with the average stock in the s    p  
jeff dietert  an analyst with simmons  company in houston  said dynegy  s estimates for its earnings in  were   conservative and very achievable   
mr  watson said friday that dynegy was confident that enron  s operations and its trading business were healthy    we feel this is a very solid company with plenty of capacity to withstand whatever happens the next few months    he said 
mr  dietert said dynegy needed to strike a deal with enron quickly to make sure that enron  s trading operations and financial health did not deteriorate any further    if enron preserves the value of the marketing and trading company  then there is clearly value in the enron stock    he said 
preserving enron  s investment  grade credit rating is crucial to keeping the trading operation afloat  to help convince moody  s investors service and standard  poor  s  the major rating agencies  that enron  s rating should remain investment  grade  dynegy has agreed to inject     billion into enron immediately  still  on friday  both agencies cut enron  s rating to just one notch above noninvestment grade  or junk  status  and both suggested that the rating could fall further 
so investors and creditors will watch carefully this week to see whether other energy companies continue trading with enron  and whether the merger stems the outflow of talented enron traders 
another question hanging over the deal is how easy it will be for dynegy to walk away if enron  s finances turn out to be worse that enron has already disclosed 
the merger agreement  according to executives and investment bankers who shaped it  gives dynegy the opportunity to quit the deal without penalty if major new problems surface  but what exactly those terms are remains unknown 
so far  investors are giving dynegy the benefit of the doubt  the company  s stock rose  percent on thursday and friday 
  the market believes chuck watson and the dynegy management team are very disciplined in the way they manage risks    mr  dietert said

basic principle of accounting tripped enron

 copyright  c    dow jones all six defendants have denied the sec  s allegations  andersen itself wasn  t named as a defendant and has said it believes the lawsuit against its partner was an unjustified action over questions of professional judgment 
under gaap  misstatements aren  t immaterial simply because they fall beneath a numerical threshold  according to an sec accounting bulletin  under certain circumstances   and it remains to be seen if they apply in the enron case   the sec says intentional immaterial misstatements are unlawful  one reason is that when immaterial misstatements are combined with other misstatements  they can  render the financial statements taken as a whole to be materially misleading  
enron  which paid andersen   million last year in audit fees and   million for other services  is one of andersen  s biggest clients  so far  mr  tabolt  the andersen spokesman  says the sec hasn  t told andersen it is a subject of the enron probe 
enron  s disavowal of its previous financial statements also is a major embarrassment for the directors who sit on the enron board  s audit committee  which serves as the overseer of enron  s financial reporting  internal controls and compliance processes  among the committee members is wendy gramm  a former chairman of the commodity futures trading commission and the wife of u  s  sen  phil gramm  r   texas   ms  gramm also was a member of the audit committee of ibp inc   a meatpacking company that earlier this year became engulfed in an accounting debacle that prompted an sec investigation and nearly derailed tyson foods  since  completed plan to buy the company 
enron last week said its audit committee had been responsible for conducting annual reviews of the transactions between enron and the partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew s  fastow  the company said its special committee is investigating  whether those controls and procedures were properly implemented   through an enron spokeswoman  ms  gramm declined to comment

new york  nov   reuters   prudential securities on monday raised its investment rating on enron corp  to  hold  from  sell   citing the proposed buyout of the company by its smaller power  trading rival dynegy inc  for some   billion in stock

but it added that it is uncertain whether the deal will help prevent enron  s energy  trading partners from reducing transactions and  or credit exposure over the next few months 
prudential said it is also concerned about strategic and cultural differences between dynegy and enron  and believes that the risk of losing talented traders before the transaction closes is high

wessex water could become a takeover target for thames water as troubles continue to engulf its u  s 
parent 
the bath  based utility  which employs around    people  is one of several uk businesses owned by enron  which last week was forced to slice more than   million  gbp  million  from its reported profits for the past five years 
enron  s much  smaller rival dynergy is set to buy the troubled giant for   billion  gbp    billion   although the plunging value of enron has become a sticking point 
enron  north america  s biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas  bought wessex for gbpl   billion in  
at the time it said it planned to use wessex  s expertise as the foundation stone of global water company azurix 
but few contracts have been secured as azurix has constantly found itself outbid by larger groups and the failure of the water business has only added to enron  s troubles 
weekend speculation suggested thames water was poised to pounce on wessex as enron  s financial position gets weaker 
thames water  s german utility group owner rwe is keen to expand its water interests in the uk and has considered bidding for wessex in the past 
in august it was said to be running the slide rule over the firm to bolster its uk interests 
it acquired thames  the neighbouring water company to wessex  last year for gbp    billion 
a thames move for wessex would attract the attention of the industry regulator and previous similar takeover bids have been blocked 
but the fact that the two are neighbours  wessex supplies an area stretching from wiltshire to somerset and dorset  while thames goes from london to swindon  could weigh in the favour of any bid  along with enron  s shaky financial position 
enron last week acknowledged it overstated earnings by about  per cent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investigation by the u  s  securities and exchange commission 
the sec said enron  s financial statements from  through the first half of   should not be relied upon  and that outside businesses run by enron officials during that period should have been included in the company  s earnings reports 
enron  s debt ratings have also been reduced to one level above junk bond status and the company  s long  term debt ratings remain under review for further downgrade 
on friday uk energy watchdog ofgem said it was monitoring how the financial crisis could impact on the uk market 
as well as owning wessex  enron has three power plants on teesside whose customers include suppliers  generators and distributors

setting up these private partnerships and making deals with them

enron is facing corruption charges  and this time it has nothing to do with maharashtra  the shock waves began when the company announced in early october that it had a   million  rs    crore  loss in the third quarter and also disclosed write  offs to the tune of     billion  rs    crore  due to some questionable transactions 
two of these deals were made public in the last couple of weeks  in one  mr andrew fastow  the company  s chief financial officer  ran a private partnership called ljm  co  investment lp  named with the initials of his wife and children  with whom enron had several financial transactions  the aim of the transactions was to hedge against fluctuating values in some of enron  s investments 
mr fastow and other enron employees who were a part of this partnership made millions in fees and investment gains in their personal accounts 
mr  fastow was fired after the revelations  second  the company is said to have made a    million  rs   crore  purchase from an entity called chewco investments lp  run by michael kopper  managing director of its north america unit  this deal is seen as an attempt by enron to park some of its debt elsewhere 
enron  which began as a natural gas and energy products company  has made important forays into retail energy and bandwidth products  and its growth has been phenomenal  from   billion  rs    crore  in revenues in   the company  in   had revenues of   billion  rs    crore   in    alone  it grew  per cent 
as an energy trader  the company is a dominant force in the markets 
it extended its trading skills and software infrastructure into the bandwidth area  where it has met with more limited success  however  another venture  named azurix  focussed on managing water supply and headed by rebecca mark  of dabhol fame  was a failure  leading to her exit from the company 
some analysts are now beginning to wonder if the phenomenal results of the company have something to do with its creative accounting  enron is said to have borrowed large sums of money for asset purchases without the debt showing up on the company  s balance sheet 
analysts who often write about enron use terms like  byzantine  and  labyrinth  in describing its financial dealings  now  they are admitting that they did not really understand what was going on  enron has been very secretive when it comes to revealing its financial arrangements 
clearly  the company seems to have se  up all these private partnerships to make its balance sheet look clean and nice  in return  it allowed its senior employees to profit and fatten their wallets through the fees paid for the transactions  was it the price paid to keep quiet  s pc manufacturers will have more freedom to ship machines with non  microsoft products and the company cannot retaliate against them  and it will have to establish standard royalties and licensing terms  more interestingly  a three  member panel will be located at microsoft headquarters with staff and access to company records to monitor compliance with the settlement  the period is initially for five years  and is extendable to two more 
while microsoft may not secure high marks for the quality of its products  the company has always been a leader with its strategy  though technology  savvy users of personal computers have always praised apple for its hardware and its operating system  microsoft is the one that has climbed to dominate with  per cent market share  and this is because it quickly worked with allies to establish its operating system as the more widely used standard 
with comparable astuteness  the company managed to drag the anti  trust case long enough till a more sympathetic president occupied the white house  the anti  trust head under the democratic president clinton was joel klein  who was seen as a hawk  doggedly pursuing the company 
so microsoft waited it out  while making significant monetary contributions to the republican party  even on the campaign trail  mr george bush made it known that he was not such a fervent devotee of anti  trust 
once he came to power  the newly appointed anti  trust chief quickly moved to compromise and settle 
the proposed settlement is not leaving everyone happy  the other private corporations that were affected by microsoft  s practices are clearly disappointed with the terms of the settlement  america online  now incarnated as aol time warner  is the biggest internet service provider  with about  million subscribers  and benefited from partnership with microsoft  but the new windows xp only has the company  s own msn service and its own messaging system  cutting out aol 
sun microsystems is another affected party  sun  s java software allowed the same piece of computer code to run on many different kinds of computers  but the new windows xp has dropped support for java  thus  both sun and aol  among others  feel closed out and do not see any change in microsoft  s monopolistic behaviour 
it is this fact that has also upset about six of the state governments  which are also parties to the suit  at the time of writing  they have refused to sign on  massachusetts  for one  has protested that it is an ineffectual deal 
microsoft bravely moves on  surviving a possible threat of break  up  like a juggernaut crushing all that come in its path  but a recent wall street journal report has it that the controversy has taken its toll within  that employee morale is down  and several key people have left the company  even if it manages to close the chapter on its us legal troubles  the company still faces an investigation by the european commission

one of the world  s largest energy trading groups  enron corp  has staved off financial collapse after securing a  us  billion      billion  rescue bid from dynegy  ending a crisis which threatened to cause major disruption to us power and natural  gas markets 
enron shares have plunged  per cent this year following investigations by us regulatory authorities into accounting irregularities which limited its ability to finance operations 
under the terms of the deal struck in the united states on friday  investors will receive    of a dynegy share for each enron share 
this is worth  usl     based on dynegy  s closing price on friday 
chevrontexaco corp  a  per cent shareholder in dynegy  has agreed to provide enron with an upfront cash injection of  usl   billion  dynegy said it would assume about  usl  billion in enron debt 
the new company will have  us  billion in assets while dynegy  s shareholders  including chevrontexaco  will have  per cent of the new company  enron  s holders will own the rest 
however  the deal is likely to be opposed by consumers in california after dynegy and enron were blamed for soaring electricity prices that left that state  s biggest utility bankrupt and the second  largest fighting for a government bailout 
in recent months  enron shares plunged as investors began to question the accuracy of enron  s financial statements  saying it was unclear whether the company was using affiliated partnerships to move debt off its books and hide losses 
on friday  the company restated its earnings for the past four years  lowering them by more than  us  million to include losses from partnerships it once kept off its books  after the merger announcement  standard  poor  s investors service said it may lower dynegy  s debt rating  it cut enron  s to   bbb    one notch above junk 
dynegy will have annual revenue of more than  us  billion  more than    mw of electric  generating capacity and    km of pipeline after the merger 
the company would save as much as  us  million a year by   winding down   enron  s business outside of trading and pipelines and cutting costs  dynegy said 
the two houston  based companies began negotiations a week ago as it became apparent that enron needed cash to stay in business 
dynegy agreed to the terms after moody  s investors service maintained an investment grade rating on enron  eliminating a stumbling block in negotiations 
moody  s announcement removed the threat that a junk rating would force enron to repay early     billion in bonds 
enron fired chief financial officer mr andrew fastow last month as a us securities and exchange commission investigation focused in on partnerships he headed and helped create  enron estimated mr fastow made  us  million through partnerships affiliated with it

mumbai  nov  asia pulse  mumbai high court on friday  in an ad  interim order  restrained enron  s dabhol power company  dpc  from serving final termination notice on maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  until december  
the order was delivered by justice d k deshmukh who ordered that status quo be maintained on the dispute between dpc and mseb  which had resulted in the former serving preliminary notice on the board 
the court was hearing a notice of motion in a suit filed by financial institutions led by the industrial development bank of india and others urging for directions to restart the plant and generate power  so that their investments were secured 
the judge ruled that the   day period beginning november   during which the dpc could serve the final termination notice as per the ppa  would not expire 
on behalf of the plaintiffs  solicitor general harish salve  argued that financial institutions were ensuring safe returns of their lendings  of the rs  billion  s     billion  investment in the controversial  mw project the debt component was about  per cent  amounting to rs    billion 
of this debt component  the indian fis  exposure was to the tune of rs  billion  he disclosed 
the only way to secure the loans was that the plant should be made operational so that dpc gets revenue from power generation  he said

financial times
dynegy agreed a     bn  e    bn  rescue bid for enron  at the end of last week  after the largest us electricity and gas trader narrowly escaped having its credit ratings cut to junk status 
moody  s  the ratings agency  reduced its credit rating on enron  s unsecured debt from baa  to baa   after being briefed the previous day by enron 
enron  s new rating is just one notch above junk status 
a deeper downgrade would have forced enron to sell stock to cover about     bn of obligations  and could have deterred dynegy 
dynegy is offering just under    of its own shares per enron share  valuing the bid at     per enron share  or   above enron  s price at the close of trading on friday 
enron will also receive an immediate cash injection of around     bn from chevrontexaco  which owns   of dynegy  and a further   bn when the deal closes 
the initial infusion will be made through dynegy  and chevrontexaco will receive rights over     bn of the merged company  s stock 
to protect its investment  dynegy will receive preferred stock in an enron subsidiary that owns gas pipeline assets 
if the merger were not completed  dynegy would have the right to acquire the subsidiary  s equity 
the merged company will be called dynegy  and dynegy executives will take the roles of chairman  chief executive officer  president and chief financial officer 
chuck watson  chairman and chief executive of dynegy  said the combined group would keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure 
dynegy added that enron  s accounting issues would not detract from the value of its businesses and predicted annual savings of   m to   m from the acquisition 
arthur andersen  enron  s auditor  is understood to have approved the controversial off  balance sheet arrangement used by enron to manage its trading risks and offload debt 
the arrangements are at the heart of the energy company  s decision to review its accounts earlier last week 
in a regulatory filing late last week  enron indicated that its decision to restate its accounts to include two off  balance companies was based on current information  implying full details had not been available before 
a third accounting change was based on a new assessment  enron said  raising questions about the auditor  s earlier judgement 
an andersen spokesman refused to comment on whether the auditor had vetted the complex off  balance sheet arrangements 
he said that the firm does help companies understand accounting rules and how to apply them 
comment  dynegy presumably has been given a fuller and franker explanation of enron  s off  balance sheet mess than its investors  but it can scarcely have been able to carry out what normally counts as due diligence 
moody  s decision and s  p  s indecision meant enron kept its investment grade and seems to have got the deal done 
do ratings agencies really provide independent analysis at these times 
the times
the deal comes amid a securities and exchange commission investigation into enron  s controversial business practices 
enron admitted late last week that it had overstated its profits by nearly   m and understated its debt by     bn over the past four years 
enron  s disposal of its share in a     bn indian power plant was blocked by the bombay high court 
anxiety increased that us energy traders were starting to bypass enron  s internet  based energy trading systems over worries that the company could not pay for transactions and pay back collateral 
the daily telegraph
enron  s problems have already affected the european energy trading market  where the buying and selling of power on long  and short  term contracts helps balance demand and reduces the risk of price volatility 
innogy and txu are understood to be picking up some of enron  s lost business to restore stability to the market 
dynegy may sell some of enron  s non  trading business in the uk as part of any financial restructuring

bond investors last week were so concerned about the demise of enron  the beleaguered us energy trading group  that they were trading as if the company would default on its bonds within days 
several us investors  mainly hedge funds  were short selling a dollar bond that matures this week  said credit traders 
short selling involves an investor selling securities they do not own  in order to profit from a fall in prices 
the short selling of bonds that are about to be repaid is unheard of unless there is a fear that the issuer will not make the repayment 
at the same time  it was impossible to buy enron credit default swaps  a type of insurance against the company defaulting 
most of the short selling took place on wednesday  the day before enron  headed by kenneth lay  confirmed that it was in talks to be bought by arch rival dynergy 
news of the possible merger led hedge funds to unwind their short positions  at a loss 
enron  s fall from grace has also added to pressure on auditing firms to do their job more diligently 
arthur andersen was enron  s auditor over the    accounts that enron last week had to restate 
enron investors have suggested that arthur andersen had not pushed enron hard enough to disclose details about the partnerships that had complex ties with it and were run by former cfo  andrew fastow 
arthur andersen faces a lawsuit  which suggests that the accounting firm was compromised by enron paying the firm above standard auditing and non  auditing fees 
the southern electrical retirement fund of oregon said in the suit   maintaining the client relationship was dependent on the individual defendants  particularly enron  s lay  and arthur andersen compromised themselves to do so

andersen faces jeopardy in enron accounting error  experts say
houston  nov    bloomberg    arthur andersen llp may face
u  s  securities and exchange commission sanction and shareholder
lawsuits because it certified enron corp  financial reports that
the company disavowed last week as inaccurate  legal and
accounting experts said 
andersen  the world  s fifth largest accounting firm  served
as enron  s outside auditor for more than a decade  assuring
investors the company  s financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles  last week  the company
reported that it overstated earnings by   million over four 
and  a  half years  inflated shareholder equity by     billion
because of an   accounting error    and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet 
enron restated its financial reports as the company
suffered a cash crisis triggered by disclosure of the cut in
shareholder equity and the start of an sec investigation  on
friday  enron  the largest energy trader  agreed to be
acquired by dynegy inc  for   billion in stock and assumed
debt 
  i  d be very surprised if the sec didn  t go after arthur
andersen    said alan bromberg  securities law professor at
southern methodist university and author of a six  volume treatise
on securities fraud    i think they  ll have a hard time ignoring
this one   
andersen partner david tabolt has said the firm is
cooperating with a special committee of enron  s board of
directors appointed to investigate the accounting problems 
  issues have surfaced that have caused the company to
restate its financial statements and advise investors that they
should not rely on its financial statements or our audit
reports    tabolt said  adding    we certainly recognize the
appropriateness of that decision   
settled suits
the sec and shareholders can sue an accounting company for
issuing false and misleading financial reports about a publicly
traded company  andersen this year paid   million to settle
lawsuits alleging the firm allowed waste management inc  and
sunbeam corp  to file false financial reports that cost investors
billions of dollars in losses 
lynn turner  who was the sec  s chief accountant for three
years until he resigned in august  said enron and andersen
ignored a basic accounting rule when they overstated
shareholder  s equity 
explaining the equity reduction last week  enron said
it had given common stock to companies created by enron  s
former chief financial officer in exchange for notes
receivable  and then improperly increased shareholder equity
on its balance sheet by the value of the notes 
 basic accounting 
  what we teach in college is that you don  t record equity
until you get cash for it  and a note is not cash    said turner 
who is now director of the center for quality financial reporting
at colorado state university    it  s a mystery how both the
company would violate  and the auditors would miss  such a basic
accounting rule  when the number is one billion dollars   
enron paid andersen   million last year    million for
auditing and   million for services including business and tax
consulting  due diligence procedures and help in preparing sec
filings  according the company  s proxy statement  enron and
andersen declined to provide further detail 
those fees were proportionately larger than some other
companies paid outside auditors  exxon mobil  the world  s largest
oil company  with more than twice enron  s     billion of
revenue  paid  percent less to its auditor 
 llp  dynegy  which is also audited by
andersen  paid     million for its audit and     million in
other fees  that is  percent less than enron paid  dynegy  s
revenue of     billion was  percent less than enron  s 
consulting work
john coffee  adolf a  berle professor of law at columbia
university law school  said he is concerned about the   million
enron paid andersen for non  audit work    if you had an auditor
that wasn  t trying to cross  sell other services with more profit
potential  would it have been as acquiescent    coffee asked 
andersen  s tabolt defended the firm  s consulting work for
enron    we help improve the quality of financial reporting by
helping clients understand the accounting rules and how to apply
them    said tabolt    in doing this  we follow the rules of the
profession and the sec   
in the waste management and sunbeam cases  shareholders and
the sec alleged that andersen allowed the companies to inflate
earnings and revenue  the firm agreed last week to pay  
million to settle a malpractice lawsuit over its audit work for
waste management  last june  andersen agreed to pay a   million
civil fine  the largest ever imposed by the sec against a big 
five accounting firm 
 black eyes 
in april  andersen agreed to pay   million to settle a
securities fraud class action suit filed over its accounting work
for appliance maker sunbeam corp  the appliance maker filed for
bankruptcy protection in february 
  andersen now has three black eyes in a row    said coffee 
who addressed the national institute on class actions of the
american bar association on friday in san francisco  the group  s
members are lawyers who have collected billions of dollars for
investors in securities fraud class action suits against public
companies 
  there  s a beauty contest going on    said coffee 
referring to meetings taking place at the conference  he said law
firms are courting some of enron  s institutional investors for
the right to represent them against the energy company and its
auditor 
andersen  s tabolt said the sec hasn  t notified the firm that
it is under investigation in connection with its work for enron 
coffee expressed concern that sec chairman harvey pitt 
who took over the agency in august  may not be as aggressive
in pursuing accounting fraud as his predecessor  arthur
levitt  as a private lawyer  pitt represented major
accounting firms 
  anyone who violates the law  and i do mean anyone 
will be held to the same high standards the agency has
applied for nearly seven decades    said pitt in an
interview    there are no special rules for any class of
violator    he declined to comment on enron and andersen

houston  nov    bloomberg    dynegy inc  chairman chuck
watson said he  s convinced enron corp   s trading operations are
sound and described disclosures about affiliated partnerships that
helped drive enron  s stock down  percent in three weeks as
  financial noise   
dynegy agreed friday to buy enron for at least   billion 
including at least   billion in stock and   billion in assumed
debt  in an interview after the merger announcement  watson and
enron chairman kenneth lay discussed how the houston  based
companies reached agreement less than three weeks after enron  s
shares began plunging 
  all the financial noise about the partnerships  maybe it
has damaged the enron brand a bit    watson said    but i  ll tell
you what it hasn  t impacted  and that  s the high regard that the
industry places on   enron  s trading business  he said 
enron last week restated earnings for four years to include
losses from three affiliated partnerships  reducing earnings by
  million 
six employees  out of enron  s     may have improperly
benefited from the partnerships  lay said 
  i  m sorry those six people seem to have gone somewhat over
the edge in their dealings or transactions  but you can  t be
absolutely protected from that in any business    he said 
lost effectiveness
lay didn  t specify which six people he was referring to  he
removed andrew fastow  who helped set up and ran many of the
affiliated partnerships  as chief financial officer on oct    an
enron securities filing says fastow made more than   million off
two of the partnerships 
fastow   had lost his effectiveness because of all the press
coverage   on the affiliates  lay said 
treasurer ben glisan and kristina mordaunt  a managing
director and a corporate counsel for an enron division  also were
fired  enron said in a corporate filing on thursday  former
employees michael kopper  kathy lynn and anne yeager were in a
position to profit from partnerships  the filing said 
  you trust people  you accept their representations and
proposals    lay said    sometimes when you do that  you get
surprised and disappointed   
both executives said they expect antitrust regulators to
approve the merger because the two companies own different types
of assets and won  t dominate any market 
  there really isn  t anything that lays on top of each
other    watson said friday night    we  re not in the pipeline
business and they are  we  re in the generation business  and
they  re really not   
dynegy shares rose    percent on friday after terms of the
enron purchase leaked to the press  watson expects the acquisition

average price over the past  months 
enron stock climbed  cents to     in germany as

cash crunch
the rapid decline of enron threatened to bankrupt the company
and disrupt energy markets  enron handles an estimated one  quarter
of u  s  electricity and natural  gas trades  a falling credit
rating made it difficult for the company to raise capital needed
to back trades 
as part of the purchase  chevrontexaco corp   which owns 
percent of dynegy  agreed to provide enron with     billion 
  what we found when looked under the hood is that the core
of enron was still there and working as well as ever    watson
said    that business was pristine and had nothing to do with the
partnerships   
dynegy began taking steps toward the acquisition in late
october  when watson called lay to offer assistance with enron  s
growing financial crisis  the two men said  that led to a saturday
morning meeting in lay  s kitchen 
  he even made me a breakfast roll    watson said 
  he didn  t eat it    lay said 
lay said he won  t be an active manager in the new company 
watson said friday that he and lay hadn  t discussed a severance
package 
as head of enron  lay had refocused the houston operator of
u  s  natural  gas pipelines on trading and international expansion 
boosting reported revenue   fold since  to     billion
last year  he said he doesn  t regret the strategy 
  clearly  enron has gotten involved in business that hasn  t
turned out well    lay said  pointing to money  losers azurix inc  
created to supply water and build related projects around the
world  and newpower holdings inc   a seller of electricity to
homes and small businesses    but you have to keep in mind  too 
that  years ago we weren  t in the wholesale merchant  trading 
business  today that  s an incredibly valuable franchise   
the trading business  which accounts for about  percent of
enron  s revenue  buys electricity  gas and other commodities from
producers and sells them to end users such as utilities and
industrial customers  it also advises big business customers on
energy use and sells them gas and electricity 
reassessing steel  lumber
watson said the new company will keep trading coal  gas 
power and petroleum products  and plans to expand by buying assets
and using them to develop trading    we  ll just have to reassess
over time whether we stay in   trading of steel  lumber and other
non  energy commodities  he said 
enron wants to shed its  percent stake in dabhol power co 
in india  which is owed   million in overdue bills from a state
government agency that has refused to pay the power prices enron
was promised in contracts 
  we have strong legal remedies and we  re heading down the
path toward arbitration  but we  d still very much like to work out
a settlement with the government    lay said  potential buyers
have balked at enron  s   billion asking price for dabhol 
neither man would comment on whether dynegy plans to cut jobs
after the merger  or what will happen to the naming rights to

this enron  ene  nyse  news  commentary  deal is anything but definitive  in fact  it has so many loopholes in it that one has to believe that dynegy  dyn  nyse  news  commentary  may be going through the whole thing just to learn from the master   or to learn what not to do  depending on your ethics 
i can  t recall a deal with this many breakup provisions  pipelines going here  money going there  money from chevron  cvx  nyse  news  commentary   not dynegy  caps on liabilities 
to me it seems to be a bit of a charade  i don  t think  personally  there is anything at enron besides one pipeline that will generate a couple of hundred million in cash and lots of liabilities  some known  others not 
the idea that enron  s traders and its trading desk are an asset is under heavy assault  why would you want to buy something that may have made no money 
on top of all of that is the possibility of massive antitrust action brought by consumers for what may have been a scheme to keep electricity off the california market 
go ahead  short dynegy and go long enron  just make sure you have calls on dynegy and puts on enron to put  you  ll need them
