in a nutshell 
the governor and assembly leadership  without rod wright  have reached
agreement and believe they have the  votes to support the below 
o there will be a     billion bailout that can be used to pay the qf  s and
the banks  but not the generators  either directly or indirectly  and will be
recovered through a dedicated rate component charged to consumers  kwh and
above 
o business and consumer interests are being briefed at the moment by the
staff of davis and angelides on the proposal 
o the easement language is consistent with the language proposed in  xx
o the renewable portfolio standard language is primarily consistent with
 xx however discussions on final language are continuing now 
o regarding the transmission lines and direct access  language has not been
written and discussions are also continuing  in fact much of the bill is
being drafted now and is said to circulate tomorrow among members  davis
has indicated that he wants a vote as soon as thursday
o the senate has not agreed  but there are staff meetings going on now 
o the cpuc has not involved in the discussions  but the administration
continues to assure that no cpuc action will be taken in contrary to the
language of the bill 
please feel free to call with questions and as always we will keep you
posted
