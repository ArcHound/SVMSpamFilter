ene  reiterate buy  believe leadership still intact
 ene has underperformed its peer group of energy merchants  stock
price down   from   week high    on august   vs  peer group  up     
 we reiterate our buy rating on the stock  and believe the weakness
is largely due to concern over ene  s group  high p  e multiple and peg ratio
of  x and    x  respectively  group average  x and    x   coupled with a
series of concerns over various parts of enron  s business  bandwidth  india 
etc 
 our sense is that the bandwidth unit is performing on target  and is
likely to beat the strong numbers posted last quarter  india  while a
significant issue  remains a small part of enron  s asset base  about    
it is a legacy business  in our view  and does not materially affect our
overall view of the company 
 we see ene  s business fundamentals intact  and in fact  improving 
growth rate expansion to   from    growing returns on capital  bandwidth
trading all good reasons to own stock   justify premium valuation
