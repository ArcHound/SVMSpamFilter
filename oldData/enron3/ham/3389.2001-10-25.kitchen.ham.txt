i believe what you are seeing is names of enron networks employees who are placing orders on behalf of ena  when this happens these employees are responsible for obtaining prior approval for the responsible party within the cost center their are ordering for  additionally all it hardware purchases must be reviewed and approved by a technical buyer once the cost center financial approval is obtained  therefore  some of the individuals which you see listed in the approver  and approver  columns will not be ena employees 
please advise if you have any additional questions 
thanks
