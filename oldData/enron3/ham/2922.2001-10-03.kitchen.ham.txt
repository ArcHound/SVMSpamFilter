with the     million to ship mhi turbines  and   the summary of the numbers is the following 
therefore  we would be about     over the original dash  these numbers do not include transaction and financing costs  i will do a dash amendment and am copying louise on this email so that she is aware of what is going on  the storeage would be in a bonded warehouse  so no duties would be due at this time  on leads  we have a couple of new parties  but nothing concrete yet  ron has been working with one counterparty and may receive an offer in the near term

the proposed plan on the mhi units is to ship units  and  to the us for storeage at a central location  the storeage costs are significantly less than proposed by mhi and the ability to centralize all of the shipments will be beneficial for a potential sale  from an economic perspective  it would be better if we had a sale in the short term and could ship directly  however  given a lack of any firm sale  the recommendation is to ship them to the us and store  let me know if you are in agreement with going forward with the shipment 
thanks

i would like to have a meeting today regarding the storage of mhi  f units     we have received a proposal from mhi for these units to be stored in japan which is attached  i believe we have better options if mhi persists in their views on how the unit will be stored and enron is charged for these services  i would like for you to review and offer comments and suggestions  i have also attached the letter i sent to them outlining our requirements 
does anytime from    p work for everyone 
copy lorie leigh  lisa zarsky on your availability and they will coordinate a meeting for this afternoon 
thanks  ron
