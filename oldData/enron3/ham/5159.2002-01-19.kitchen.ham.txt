couple of comments on the contract 
 if i am terminated w  o cause  either the non  compete  non  solicit provision shall not apply or i should be paid a severance  as i see it  the bonus payments and incentive awards are current incentive to be part of ubs and can not be considered severance in the event of termination w  o cause  my preference is to be released from the non  compete  non  solicit provisions  if ubs prefers severance  it should be a total payout of the contract  the existing payments and equity  base salary and anticipated bonus    of pro  forma bonus pool  
 doesn  t enron need to sign this as well or at least have a side letter that addresses the references to enron 
 two people have asked about accelerating the payout date so that the first payment is at closing  the second is  months from now and the equity vests at  months and then  months  i would like to tell them that no one is getting that  true 
regards
