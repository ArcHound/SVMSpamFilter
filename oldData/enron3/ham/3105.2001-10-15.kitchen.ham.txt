houston  oct   reuters   natural gas and power marketer and trader dynegy
inc  said on monday that third  quarter net earnings rose  percent  as its
backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns 
the houston  based company said earnings rose to   million  or  cents per
diluted share  from   million  or  cents per diluted share  for the same
period of  
companywide operating revenues rose to     billion in the third quarter of
  versus     billion in the similar year  ago period 
analysts polled by thomson financial  first call expected earnings in a range
of  cents to  cents a share  with a mean estimate of  cents 
dynegy also said it raised its earnings estimate for the  year to a range
of     to     per diluted share from the     target set on oct    it
maintained a fourth  quarter forecast of  cents to  cents a share and a
 forecast of     to     share  all are in line with analysts 
estimates 
chief financial officer robert doty said that the company was on track to
achieve  percent to  percent earnings growth next year 
 our long  term strategy to focus on marketing and trading around physical
assets supports earnings sustainability   chairman and chief executive officer
chuck watson said in a statement 
 i would say the company  s ability to continuously post strong earnings growth
illustrates their ability to successfully navigate through wildly various
operating environments   ubs warburg analyst jay yannello said   this company
has rapidly emerged as the leading player in its field  
while stocks in its sector have been hammered sharply over the past six
months  dynegy has been a better performer than similar companies  dynegy  s
stock this year has fallen some  percent  outperforming the standard 
poor  s utilities index  which has lost  percent 
despite the strong earnings growth  shares of dynegy were down      or   
percent  to     in monday afternoon trading  analysts cited rumors that the
california public utilities commission  cpuc  wants to renegotiate the power
purchase contracts that the california department of water resources holds
with companies like dynegy  calpine corp   mirant corp  and williams cos 
inc  
a spokesman for the department of water resources  however  said it doesn  t
plan to renegotiate the deals 
 these companies renegotiate contracts all the time  the question is  do they
maintain value in the contracts or do they lose value in the contracts   said
analyst jeff dietert of simmons and co   and i think the assumption that the
market is making is that dynegy and others would lose value in their
contracts  
dynegy still has an accounts receivable balance of about   to   million
for power it produced for cash  challenged california utilities   we  re not out
of the woods yet   said president and chief operating officer stephen
bergstrom on a conference call 
but he noted there could be some resolution by the second or third quarter of
next year  after all  pg  e corp   s pacific and gas electric utility sought
bankruptcy in april and filed a reorganization plan on sept    edison
international  s southern california edison utility plans to pay off its
creditors by march  under a settlement it reached with the cpuc 
wholesale income nearly doubles
dynegy marketing and trade  the company  s main wholesale business  reported an
 percent year  over  year increase in recurring net income  taking in  
million this year compared with   million in the comparable quarter in
 
among other things  dynegy trades wholesale natural gas  power  coal  emission
allowances and weather derivatives 
the company attributed part of its improved performance this quarter to better
results in european and canadian operations  including increased gas marketing
in canada 
north american natural gas volumes grew  percent to    billion cubic feet
per day  bcf  d  in the quarter  rising from    bcf  d in the year  earlier
period  total physical power sales increased  percent to    million
megawatt hours  mwh  in the  third quarter  compared with    million mwh
in the same quarter a year ago 
dynegydirect  the company  s online trading platform for more than  products
and services  recorded nearly   billion in transactions in the third
quarter  the company said  since its birth in november   dynegydirect has
recorded   billion in transactions 
dynegy recently expanded the platform  its answer to hometown rival enron
corp   s wildly successful enrononline trading platform  into british energy
markets 
one nominally lower performer this year was illinois power  dynegy  s regulated
transmission and distribution subsidiary  it reported recurring net income of
  million versus   million a year earlier  dynegy attributed the smaller
figure to a reduced industrial load 
the company  s new communications segment took a   million loss for the
quarter  mostly from costs associated with developing its     mile network 
the network reaches  u  s  cities and is expected to be completed in the
fourth quarter 
dynegy expects that segment to record a fourth  quarter loss of nil to  cents
a share and a full  year loss of  cents to  cents a share  for   the
company expects the unit to be at breakeven by the end of the year
