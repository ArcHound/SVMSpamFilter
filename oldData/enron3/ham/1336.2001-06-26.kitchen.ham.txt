Subject re  alamac
thanks  it was painful  but we got through it 
the contract says  business days after satisfying the cps  that would be next monday  one problem though  aig needs  business days to notify the investors and receive the funds to complete the sale  i  ve got a call into them to see how we solve the inconsistency
