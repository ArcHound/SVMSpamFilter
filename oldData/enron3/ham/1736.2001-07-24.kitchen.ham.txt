here are some bullet points for the discussions tomorrow 
 east power  including generation investments made about   million in the first half  the greatest contribution came from ben jacoby  about   million  by the way  i hired ben along with scott healy to acquire sites in  
 all of the traders and structuring  including bernie aucoin told me that john llodra drove both the cmp and nstar deals  total income     million 
 i believe delainey was correct in saying that ozzie was the brains behind alamac but heather did the execution  total income for the east     million 
 most of the rest of the deals were done after i came in 
 mid market sales have increased     over the first half of  
 this group was in meltdown when i came in  at least on the origination side   i would like to get some credit for stopping the bleeding and starting the rebuilding process in a difficult environment
