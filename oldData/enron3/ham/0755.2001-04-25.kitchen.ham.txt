subject  aep interest payment vs  coastline lawsuite costs
louise 
i have developed the attached proposal that i would like to propose to aep  the basis of the proposal is that 
  aep would take on all costs  risks  liens  etc  associated with the coastline law suite  low case     mm  expected case     mm  
  enron would forego  months of interest due to aep  s failure to get doj approval      mm  
benefits to enron 
  potential savings in enron expense vs  aep  s ability to capitalize the cost 
  enron still retains the  doj stick  in that interest payments start on  june instead of  may 
  enron saves time and legal costs not having to defend against the claim 
  enron does not have to wrestle with aep to get access to hpl staff who are involved in the suite   even though aep is obligated to make resources available to help us with the claim  aep will have no incentive to do so after the sale  
let me know if you have any objections or questions
