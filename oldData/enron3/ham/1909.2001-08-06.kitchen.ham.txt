subject  duke transaction
we have closed tonight the following transaction 
we sell to duke energy a series of  monthly options  july  to june    volume  mw  delivery southeast center of gravity 
strike  r    mwh for july to december   and r    mwh for january to june  
strike payable  th of month following month of delivery 
the options are automatically exercised when and if mae ex  ante price is greater than strike  duke has not the option not to exercice if mae is not settling  
price per mwh  floor  upside
upside    of  mae ex  ante price  floor 
payable by duke at the earliest of   mae invoicing date  regardless of mae agent payment  or   july  th   
we do not take mae credit risk  but only duke  s  duke takes mae credit risk 
we receive a premium of r   million upfront 
as a result  the deal is atm against our power curve  however we know that we are in rationing at least until november of this year  as a result  the mae ex  ante price will be r    mwh  if we take the most conservative scenario and assume that we collect upside in july  only  mtm is about us   million  the more rationing last  the higher in the money will the deal be  of course  immediate settlement at mae at r   of all long position would take us otm  but we do not expect this to happen very soon  
i hope that this is clear  credit is on board  i  m talking to martha stevens and her new boss stacy white to validate my assumption on the mtm 
have a great we
