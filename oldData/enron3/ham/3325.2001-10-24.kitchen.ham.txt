Subject conversation
i spoke with gregg in chicago  the transactions that i mentioned to you that were already in the works include     mm storage inventory from prime rate to current curve   pre  pay for   to   mm for ena transaction with peoples gas  meeting next week    enovate has   mm with citibank    enron    peoples  that we have been trying to get to enron treasury since march of this year 
if i get the word from you  we potentially could wrap all three of these to front cash to enron  i would need to directly make this request to tom and bill or we might send a scary signal to them and require significant enron corporate guarantees 
let me know
