enron corp  might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next  months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created  covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional enron shares  diluting the position of current shareholders 
however  enron treasurer ben glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about     billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock  the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities   known as the marlin water trust ii  the marlin water capital corp  ii  the osprey trust and osprey i  inc  the notes are coming due during the next  months 
mr  glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes  also  enron is selling other assets  proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes  which ultimately are guaranteed by enron 
he said it appears that asset sales will raise at least     billion by the end of next year  this amount includes cash proceeds of     billion from the previously announced sale of enron  s portland general electric utility unit  enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of  
 there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds  to repay the notes  mr  glisan said   but if we are wrong  we will issue equity   mr  glisan said a worst  case scenario would involve issuing as much as   billion in stock  enron said it has about  million shares outstanding 
making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in enron  s share price  in  p  m  new york stock exchange composite trading  enron shares were down  cents to      the stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about  million shares changing hands  early this year  enron stock was more than   a share 
during the past week  shares of the energy  trading giant have dropped more than    early last week  enron reported a   million third  quarter loss  resulting from     billion in write  offs  the company also disclosed a     billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by enron chief financial officer andrew s  fastow  in july  mr  fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors  on monday  enron disclosed that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the transactions related to mr  fastow  enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper 
the turmoil of the past several days prompted enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with wall street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors  enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said while  we are extremely disappointed with our stock price    our businesses are performing very well   mr  lay and other executives said enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs 
mr  fastow  the chief financial officer  took part in the conference call  but neither he nor mr  lay would answer any questions concerning the fastow  related partnership  which was known as ljm  co  investment lp  mr  lay said the sec was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement  which has raised conflict  of  interest questions among analysts and others  mr  lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions  mr  lay said he was  very concerned about the way andy  s character has been loosely tossed about   he added  we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy  
internal ljm  documents indicate that mr  fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership  billions of dollars of enron assets and stock were involved in ljm   related transactions  according to enron sec filings 
during the conference call  analysts   even some who have been longtime enron fans   challenged executives about the fastow partnership arrangement and the company  s often opaque financial reports   there  s the appearance you are hiding something   said goldman sachs analyst david fleischer   you need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board  
mr  lay responded   we  re trying to be as transparent as we can

enron has ample access to cash  the company  s chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write  offs stemming from unusual financing activities 
in a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after enron  s stock plunged on monday  the chief executive  kenneth w  lay  strongly defended the company  s chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the securities and exchange commission was looking into 
but he refused to go into detail on the transaction that enron made with partnerships run by andrew s  fastow  the chief financial officer  in addition  mr  fastow  while declaring that enron   expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations    declined to answer any questions about it 
the conference call  which began just as trading opened on the new york stock exchange  at first seemed to be reassuring investors  within minutes of the beginning of the call  the share price rallied to      but it soon began falling  and ended the day down  cents  at      the day  s low of     was the lowest since jan      and was down  percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of  
until recently  most investors focused on the company  s reported operating earnings  which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets  but the focus has shifted to a series of transactions  some involving off  balance  sheet financing  one  involving partnerships controlled by mr  fastow  led to a     billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to s  e  c  inquiries that the company disclosed on monday 
one of the company  s strongest supporters has been david fleischer  an analyst at goldman  sachs  but he told mr  lay on the call yesterday that enron had to be more forthcoming with information    there is an appearance that you are hiding something    he said 
after the call  mr  fleischer expressed disappointment    they  ve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about  and that are hard to understand    he said in an interview    they have not been as forthcoming in explaining them   as is needed  he said  but he said he was still recommending the stock    i don  t think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans    he said    in the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company  there is tremendous value here   
mr  lay cited the s  e  c  inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by mr  fastow  but he emphasized that both he and the company  s board   continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy   
mr  lay said that auditors from arthur andersen had carefully reviewed enron  s reporting in conjunction with another off  balance  sheet vehicle  called marlin  that company owns one  third of azurix  an enron subsidiary that owns wessex  a british water utility  the auditors   have determined there is no write  down required    he said under questioning by richard grubman of highfields capital management  a money management firm 
mr  grubman said that marlin owed almost   billion on debt that was guaranteed by enron but had no assets other than the azurix stake  noting that enron had paid about   million to buy a third of azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write  downs on its investment in azurix  mr  grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt  which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of enron shares 
mr  lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details  eventually he cut off mr  grubman    i know you  re trying to drive the stock price down  and you  ve done a pretty good job of it    mr  lay said    but let  s move on to the next question   
mr  fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had     billion in such debt outstanding  he said it was backed by     billion in bank lines of credit  of which     billion will expire next may if it is not renewed 
mr  lay said he was sorry about   the misunderstanding   that resulted when his brief mention of the     billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts  that reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report  but it did not  he said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future  but made no promises 
the large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings  and so was not in the earnings release  but it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement  the s  e  c  is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct 
after one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as marlin  mr  lay said the company   will look into providing   such statements

surge in optimism prompts straddles in enron and cisco

new york   bullish calls traded heavily early as investors  encouraged by the ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares  bought calls to replace stock holdings and to ride any rallies 
at one point  the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the chicago board options exchange fell to     compared with    friday and monday  s three  month closing low of    
the surge of optimism   also evident in the cboe market  volatility index  or vix   prompted traders to begin covering the downside  just as the widely watched stock indexes began to retreat  contrarians believe the cboe equity put  call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below     by the session  s end  the ratio was at    
buyers drove robust call trading in cisco systems  a maker of internet switching equipment  and the implied volatility also rose  noted a trader at letco  the cboe specialist for cisco options  one investor bought thousands of january  calls  paying about   a contract for the right to buy  shares of the stock at   a share until mid  january  at  p  m  in nasdaq stock market trading  cisco was down  cents at      the january  calls fell  cents to  cents on cboe volume of    contracts  while    contracts traded at the pacific exchange 
the implied volatility of enron  s near  month options remains high  even as the energy concern  s executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns  following news that the securities and exchange commission is looking at the houston company 
the volatility spike makes enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles   selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration  in particular  enron  s at  the  money january  straddles offer rich premiums  said lillian seidman of the seidman  skupp options team at miller tabak  co   of new york  with enron down  cents at     in new york stock exchange composite trading  selling january  straddles would earn an investor about   a straddle   a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock 
to be sure  selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock  which already had fallen about   in a week  makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire  investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock  while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range

lay tries to assure enron investors
company  s credibility questioned

copyright  houston chronicle
enron had safeguards in place to protect shareholder interests while its chief financial officer ran two investment partnerships that did business with enron  the company  s chief executive officer said tuesday 
the houston  based energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over chief financial officer andrew fastow  s former role with two partnerships  ljm cayman and ljm  co  investment  that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with enron 
enron disclosed monday that the securities and exchange commission opened an  informal inquiry  into transactions between enron and the two partnerships 
it declined to say if the sec is looking into other transactions 
after the disclosure  enron  s stock fell almost  percent monday  tuesday it dropped another  cents to close at     
the news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on wall street that some of enron  s financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that enron doesn  t provide detailed enough financial data about its performance 
tuesday morning  enron chairman and ceo ken lay held a conference call for investors and analysts  aimed at addressing their concerns 
it remains to be seen whether he succeeded  but based on the tenor of questions during the call  it  s doubtful he achieved that result 
david fleischer  a goldman sachs analyst  told lay that the company  s credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that enron  s dealings are aboveboard 
 i  for one  find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions   he said 
lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the ljm partnerships because of the sec inquiry 
he did say enron was aware an  inherent conflict of interest  would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with enron 
in response  enron set up procedures  which lay said were rigorously followed  to ensure shareholder interests wouldn  t be compromised 
 there was a chinese wall between ljm and enron   he said  adding that enron wasn  t obligated to do deals with the ljm entities and did so when it was in enron  s best interest 
lay and enron  s board continue to have the  highest faith and confidence  in fastow  he added 
fastow resigned his roles with the ljm entities in june after criticism from wall street 
enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships 
it took a   million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders  equity by     billion as a result 
during the call enron executives also addressed other issues 
they stressed that enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles  whitewing and the atlantic water trust  that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or enron shares at the time of the investments 
if enron should lose its current investment  grade quality debt rating  commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of enron  s current outstanding shares to become diluted 
jeff dietert  an analyst with simmons others found their lines dropped mid  stream  heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives  an analyst chided for his part in lowering the company  s share price was told by ken lay  enron  s chairman  that his question quota was up and it was time to move on

enron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles  which could involve issuing additional shares  thereby diluting the position of current shareholders  the report said

according to the report  glisan said a worst  case scenario would involve issuing as much as   billion in stock 
enron held a conference call on tuesday  seeking to assuage investor concerns after u  s  regulators said they were looking into transactions involving the company  s chief financial officer and its stock shed more than   billion in value over the past week 
enron said on the call it can tap     billion from a credit line  suggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing business  which can experience wide swings in cash flow  depending on commodity prices and market hedges

new york   stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient market largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements 
shares of drug maker pharmacia fell      or    to      after the company issued third  quarter results that topped wall street  s forecasts  but also issued  profit projections that left some analysts disappointed 
in fact  several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors responded to their quarterly profit statements  shares of bristol  myers squibb  for example  gave up     or      to     american home products lost     or      to     and schering  plough eased  cents  or      to

power utility exelon  chicago  was set back     or      to     after its third  quarter results topped forecasts  but drew critical comments from several analysts 
nevertheless  even with the grim earnings outlook  investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel 
 institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market   richard cripps  market strategist at legg mason  said   their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly  which is eminently possible  and they can  t afford to miss it  
some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently  for many mutual funds  for example  their fiscal year concludes at the end of october  some are doing what is called window dressing   buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio   while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market

there were some winning profit statements  shares of csx  for example  rose     or      to     after the richmond  va   rail  freight concern reported third  quarter earnings that  while they fell short of year  ago performance  nevertheless managed to top wall street  s forecasts

chartered semiconductor  nasdaq  advanced  cents  or      to     the singapore chip foundry reported third  quarter results that showed a loss for the period  but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected

uk  lng delays could spawn shipping crisis  analysts

 c  reuters limited  
london  oct   reuters   the transport chain supporting the global lng industry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a crisis of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines  shipping analysts warn 
more lng tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of the far east  many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand  which might emerge later than scheduled 
 the issue is timing   jarle sjo  shipping equity analyst at oslo  based investment bank first securities told reuters 
 historically  lng projects have been delayed  you can estimate at about six months  and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term   he added 
the world fleet of lng tankers currently numbers   but will have swollen by about  percent by the end of   according to shipping database fairplay 
gas industry analysts expect some lng projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn  excess capacity at existing plants in asia and a sharp fall in u  s  natural gas prices this year 
svein erik amundsen  managing director of norwegian shipping group bergesen  said that a sustained economic downturn could have  consequences  
 i wouldn  t be surprised by project delays   he told reuters   this could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment  
 i think you can say we  re still optimistic  but more cautiously optimistic than before   he added  bergesen has three new lng ships on order  two of which have already been contracted out to belgian gas distributor distrigas 
stop and think
the world  s largest and only pure lng shipping player  golar lng  historically bullish in its outlook  has also been forced to stop and consider the problem 
golar has six ships locked into long  term contracts  but four more are under construction at south korea  s daewoo and hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment 
 there is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered   golar executive vp sveinung stohle told reuters   the only risk is things might be delayed  
stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option  but it was also developing an lng trading arm  which might have a use for some of them 
golar  s closest competitor in terms of size  exmar  is taking a more traditional approach  it has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance 
 we  ve chartered out all of them except the samsung ship  which is under offer for the  qatari  rasgas tender   managing director nicolas saverys told reuters  four are booked out to el paso and one to enron 
he said that until all the upcoming projects had their supply production agreements in place  it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders 
 it  s a good time to wait   said saverys

washington  ap   general motors  ibm and kmart are among corporations that would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a   billion house republican economic stimulus package  democrats say it is far too generous to companies and does too little for individuals 
seven companies would get a total of     billion in refunds of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as   the tax  which the house legislation also would repeal outright  is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and credits 
ibm would get a     billion refund  according to the nonpartisan congressional research service  while gm would get   million  kmart   million and general electric   million  others specified for big refunds include energy giant enron  at   million  u  s  steel    million  and grocery chain kroger    million 
in addition  the study found that ford motor co  would get a refund that could total     billion  while chevron  s could reach   million 
counting repeal of the tax  corporations would get more than   billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in  alone  in addition  the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business  providing them   billion in tax relief over  years 
the generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the house gop measure  scheduled for a floor vote wednesday  democrats say the measure is certain to change once it reaches the senate  the bush administration also has signaled that   billion is too costly 
 it  s clear the house bill cannot pass the senate as it is   said sen  john breaux  d  la 
for individuals  the house legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didn  t get them this summer and a cut in the current  percent income tax rate to  percent in   four years earlier than under the just  enacted tax cut  the measure also reduces capital gains rates from  percent to  percent for most taxpayers  enhances business equipment write  offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier 
the primary sponsor  ways and means committee chairman bill thomas  said in a newspaper opinion piece published tuesday in usa today that the legislation  is a shot of adrenaline  that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation 
 businesses generate jobs  and jobs are the core of a strong economy   wrote thomas  r  calif 
while bipartisan support backs some of the house items  senate democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance  sen  max baucus  chairman of the senate finance committee  presented a   billion proposal tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by  weeks  provide a  percent federal match for cobra health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for medicaid 
the legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the house bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief  tax cuts in the baucus measure would total   billion in   far below the house gop level 
 this proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times  helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly   said baucus  d  mont 
other democrats were working on spending programs  senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd  d  w  va   said he was putting together a   billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors  augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines 
sen  charles grassley  r  iowa  said president bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending 
 everything in this package needs to be stimulative   grassley said   there needs to be more done on the investment side
