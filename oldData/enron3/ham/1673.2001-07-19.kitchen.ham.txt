checklist  which is attached  of the  functional areas involved here  only one has a potential issue that would
delay a launch past the july  rd scheduled date  this is confirmlogic  some minor  bugs  were identified by
users  the confirm it group has made modifications and will retest today or tomorrow  if the testing does not
go well  there could be a production delay

are appropriate
