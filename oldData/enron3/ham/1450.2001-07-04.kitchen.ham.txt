london  july   reuters   first  half volumes on the london metal exchange
 lme  fell nearly  percent from year  ago levels amid signs that years of
rising turnover on the world  s largest non  ferrous metals market may be coming
to an end 
traders said this year had seen volumes affected by the general downturn in
global economies  weakening prices and the knock  on impact of electronic
screen trading 
 the problem is the general conditions that are prevailing at the moment  we
are seeing recessionary signs that are dampening the market  it is cyclical 
and that is the worry because the cycle is lasting some time   one said 
figures released on tuesday by the lme showed that total futures and options
turnover during jan  june  fell to    million lots  down from a
jan  june  level of    million 
traded options turnovers were significantly lower  falling to    million
lots from    million as reduced volatility deterred options interest 
although the lme derives much of its liquidity from speculators  the bulk of
its trade comes from the metals industry  hedging and price protection 
 there is consumer and producer business around  but they are very selective
at the moment   another trader said 
whether the trend continued throughout the year amd marked a sea  change after
some  years of almost uninterrupted volume growth may depend on market
conditions improving 
most of this year has seen prices progressively weaker  with copper recently
at its lowest since july   zinc and tin at levels last seen nearly eight
years ago  lead at a   month low  point and nickel and aluminium at two  month
lows 
although prices have been softer  there have been occasions when tightness has
prevailed in some markets  lifting spot premiums  but these do not generate
trades 
 these squeezes that have taken place this year in copper  aluminium and tin
in particular have not helped   the second trader said 
when the market moves from contango  when nearby prices are cheaper than
forward  into backwardation  which is the opposite  hedging dries up 
the last year has also seen electronic trading take off  with competitors such
as enron online and spectron metals grabbing business  the lme has also
sanctioned and launched its own system  known as lme select 
these still trade lme contracts  so the turnovers are not directly hit  but
screen  trading itself may be a factor 
 in some ways the screens  whoever they belong to  may be the problem   one
said 
 in the old days  you used to talk to people more  get a feel for the market 
and take a punt  not so much now  the big boys still chat  but not as much 
and with the screens it is almost a  matched bargain  situation   he said
