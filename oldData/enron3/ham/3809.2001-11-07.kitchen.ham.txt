as you know  srp made a margin call to epmi on monday  by letter  seeking     million in margin under a  one  off  contract  tracy and i sent a letter back on tuesday  arguing that the contract does not permit srp to call for additional margin unless ene is downgraded to junk status  srp responded to our letter this afternoon  predictably  srp disagrees with our view of the contract and demands its margin  srp says that it will treat our failure to post     million by monday  november   in either cash or an irrevocable letter of credit  as an event of default and will terminate the contract  if this happens  epmi would have to make a payment of     million within  days of receipt of an invoice from srp 
as you know  tracy and i strongly believe that the contract does not support srp  s right to call for margin at this time  however  the contract is not perfect  they drafted it  after all  and there is a sentence fragment that supports their position 
i recommend that we treat the srp  epmi dispute regarding the margining criteria under this agreement as a  dispute  under section   disputes are first submitted to authorized representatives  each company designates an authorized representative  to resolve  if the authorized representatives cannot reach agreement within  days  then the dispute is forwarded to you and your equivalent at srp  the  executives    the executives have to meet within  days to resolve the issue  if the executives cannot resolve the issue within  days  then both parties can choose arbitration  or either party can take the matter to court  in summary  best case  this option gets us up to  days before we have to arbitrate  litigate the issue  otherwise  we better prepare to post collateral monday 
if you want to handle this matter by taking the  dispute  route  i should send a letter out tomorrow to srp giving notice that we wish to try to resolve this through the contract  s  dispute  provisions

 i should also mention that tracy has informed me that srp plans to issue a margin call on our wspp contracts  approximately     million  as soon as it calculates the amount due
