Subject approval process for entouch
louise  
my recommendation for an approval process for entouch is as follows 
  the deadline to provide information for that week  s issue of entouch will be wednesday at    pm  all information submitted after that time will be held until the following week 
  a draft of entouch will be forwarded to each business unit head  or their designee  and commercial group head  or their designee   who has a business highlight or other information appearing in that particular issue  e  mail  phone or in  person approval will be required from either a business unit head  or their designee  or commercial group head  or their designee  prior to distribution to enron messaging administration on thursday at    pm 
  if approval is not received prior to the deadline  the business highlight or other information will be pulled until approval is received 
  in the event a business unit or commercial group provides information that crosses business unit or commercial group lines  all affected business units and commercial groups will receive the draft and a representative of each involved party will be required to approve per instruction   
i believe this process will alleviate the two problems that have occurred over the past few months  please advise 
additionally  i have attached the list of contacts kathie uses for gathering entouch information  it includes the primary contacts and their secondary contacts  please feel free to comment on this list 
thanks
