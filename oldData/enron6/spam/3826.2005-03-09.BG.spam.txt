generex
biotechnology is a toronto  based  delaware corporation with a market  ready
solution to a central challenge in diabetes treatment – ending the pain and
hassle of insulin injections  ever since scientists early in the  th
century
learned that diabetes was caused by the body ’ s inability to produce a
normal
supply of insulin  patients have had to administer insulin by injection 
alternatives
that have been developed in recent years – pumps or needle  less “ pens ” –
are
still invasive and  or expensive  pharmaceutical companies have tried to
develop
a truly non  invasive insulin product that is pain  free  easy to use and
free from
serious side effects 
among
today ’ s competing technologies  only oral  lyn ™ 
an
insulin spray to treatment diabetes  meets all those tests  after  years
of
development  oral  lyn ™ is ready for market and is
set
to produce enormous revenue growth for the company  generex
is little known outside a small community of investors focused on drug
delivery

commercial
entry of oral  lyn ™ in south
america could raise generex ’ s
profile sharply  with a commensurate rise in their share price  small
companies
in drug and medical  device development are  of course  inherently high  risk
investments  but aggressive investors who take an early stake in these
firms
can profit several times over  generex has the
profile of being one such potential winner
