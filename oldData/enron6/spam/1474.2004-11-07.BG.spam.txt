what is heartstat 
it ’ s a monitor that slips on the patient ’ s arm and measures 
  blood pressure  bp  and heart rate on a continuous basis 
  how much blood the heart pumps i  e  blood flow 
hs ’ s continuous blood pressure monitor is already fda approved  the blood flow monitor uses similar non  invasive technology and will easily pass through fda clearance  remember  using this device is as simple as sticking a band aid on a patient ’ s arm
what is the future of heartstat 
heartstat will revolutionist routine or  icu and er care  ultimately it will be in every place that patients are assessed including e  g  local doctors ’ offices and ambulances  it will provide complex  essential data in a simpler manner than routine bp cuffs tell us blood pressure readings now  and in the not too distant future it will allow optimizations of millions of patients on e  g  heart drugs  over the internet 
“ heartstat represents a true revolution in health care and will rapidly become the standard of care  ”
what is the need for heartstat 
one of the most difficult things in medicine is to decide who ’ s sick and who ’ s not  as of now there is no simple way to do this 
even super trained specialists  such as critical care doctors or anesthetists  find it difficult to recognize when a patient is going down the tube 
the traditional “ eyeballing ” the patient plus the classic four vital signs and blood oxygen levels don ’ t cut it  they tell too little too late 
prevention is always better than cure  this is what heartstat will do  it allows us to treat patients before they become catastrophically ill 
the key is blood flow  blood flow within the patient ’ s body 
currently the methods to achieve this are costly  complicated to perform  with potentially lethal complications and can only be done by highly trained experts 
· it is estimated that only five percent of patients that need monitoring can have it because of costs and the inherent risks 
· what ’ s desperately needed is a simple non  invasive device that measures blood flow  this is the holy grail of modern medicine  and this is heartstat 
overview

· blood pressure  bp  and pulse oximeter  pox  devices are the means of preventive monitoring and managing cardiovascular disease  however  these are commonly misleading and slow to reflect abnormality  often until it is too late 
· present cardiac output measurement is restricted to the most critical procedures on about only   of patients because of risks and costs 
· blood flow and perfusion are early and more specific indications for managing vital patient risks  yet this monitoring has not been practical
