top analysts predict sunncomm international  symbol  scmi  is the one undiscovered and unknown technology 
the sunncomm advantage 
sunncomm has single  handedly amassed more  firsts  in the audio copy control space than any other firm in the industry  even more impressive is the fact that these pioneering achievements have been accomplished with only a fraction of the investment capital consumed by the company  s closest competitors  in march of   the first copy controlled audio cd released in the u  s  market employed sunncomm ’ s copy management technology  the features offered within the company ’ s copy management technology have set precedents among its competitors and are fast becoming industry standards 
the company  s ability to consistently be first to market with solutions that work both technically and from a business standpoint  is a direct result of its success in developing unique and dynamic working relationships with its technology partners and customer base  these relationships have positioned the company in such a way that facilitates an exchange of knowledge between customers  such as bmg music and the company ’ s development team  this exchange of knowledge has allowed customers to become active participants in the development process and enabled them to communicate specific product needs  in turn  this process allows the company to design technology solutions that are both effective and capable of adaptability within a continuously evolving industry 
sunncomm  s founders recognized early on that  in order to reduce illicit copying  artists  record companies and distributors must offer consumers something superior to what they can easily use the internet to obtain illegally  the company also chose to offer enhanced and bonus content on its copy managed discs in order to give consumers an added incentive to comply with the wishes of copyright holders 
suncomm international  otc  scmi  has the recipe for success 
sunncomm technologies  top priority has always been 
    to develop entertainment technology that guards the content ownership rights of publishers  artists  and record companies without getting in the way of the listening experience  
our mediamax tm cd   suite of products was designed in direct response to input from the world ’ s largest record companies  and is the culmination of  years ’ work 
until mediamax cd   was introduced and tested in the last quarter of   no other available content protection enhancement technology product has been accepted by both the record industry and the cd consumer 
mediamax cd  is always evolving  sunncomm  s mediamax v      and soon  version   will allow a legitimate cd buyer the ability to enjoy the company  s play  move  maketm experience 
our goal here at sunncomm technologies is to achieve the important balance between copyright protection for content providers  and value consumers

industry quotes 
 playability is our no   concern   said nathaniel brown  a spokesman for bmg  a record  label owned by bertelsmann ag   at the moment  sunncomm is ahead of the curve in terms of playability  
wall street journal  sunncomm now stands alone within its industry  a substantial competitive advantage over macrovision  nasdaqnm  mvsn 
conclusion 
from a leverage standpoint  if there are two main competitors where one stock is trading at     per share  nasdaqnm  mvsn  and the other is  otc  scmi  trading at only  cents  a fraction of its value   which one would you bet on to go ten times your investment 
in our opinion it would be no contest  in fact what is there even to think about        it would be much easier for sunncomm  otc  scmi  to hit     per share  that ’ s ten times of its current trading price 
to achieve the same rate of return  mvsn  would have to hit      if both companies have an equal shot  the choice is certainly a no  brainer in our mind 
scmi is currently trading off of a  week low  where mvsn is trading at approximately a two percent less then its  week high  look for a dead cat bounce on  otc  scmi
