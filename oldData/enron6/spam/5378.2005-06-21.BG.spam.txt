dear client 
i am barrister mike adaeze  a lawyer in the federal republic of nigeria  i am the personal attorney to late mr  g  mckee who was a government agent in transferring of money secretly for federal government officials  he was also a merchant on petroleum products and solid minerals 
this client of mine  his wife and their only child died in an auto crash on their way to badagry beach here in nigeria on a weekend  rd september   before his death on the  rd september   my client deposited the sum of  usd   million cash  with a security and finance company  hoping to transfer it to his country as soon as he is on vacation  since his death i have made several enquiries to locate any of my late client  s relative but this has proved unsuccessful 
after these several unsuccessful attempts  i have decided to trace a trust worthy foreigner over the internet who can claim this money left behind by my client as a  next of kin  before it gets confiscated by the security company where it was deposited hence i cannot claim it myself 
the security and finance company where the money was deposited has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the deposit confiscated within the next few official working days 
since i have been unsuccessful in locating any real relative of my late client  i beg you to claim this money since you are a foreigner  this   million dollars  will be handed over to you and then both of us will share the money 
i will get the necessary legal documents that will be used to back up your claim as all i require is your honest cooperation morally  and financially to enable us see that this deal went through  i guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate time arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law
