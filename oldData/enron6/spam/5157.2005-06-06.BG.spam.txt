behold  the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth much more the wicked and the sinner  to keep thee from the evil woman  from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman  while as yet he had not made the earth  nor the fields  nor the highest part of the dust of the world  the lips of the righteous feed many but fools die for want of wisdom  for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head  and chains about thy neck
