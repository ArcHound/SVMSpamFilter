an undervalued gem on the verge of explosive growth
in this issue we are pleased to
present a company that is positioned to become the next giant in the dynamic
multi  billion dollar postal services industry 
in the  s and  s mail boxes etc  was one of the darlings of wall
street and became the industry leader as the company experienced rapid growth
by providing in  demand and convenient postal services through an
ever  increasing number of mbe stores 
then in
  industry leader mail boxes etc   mbe  was acquired by united parcel
service  ups      for   million  recently kinkos was acquired by federal
express     for     billion 
timing is now perfect
for an industry roll  up and new branded leader  the company has a very
competent and experienced management team and an aggressive plan to consolidate
the highly fragmented postal services industry and emerge as a recognized
brand  thereby capturing a significant market share 
today the
postal services industry is booming and encompasses approximately   
domestic outlets that generate annual gross revenues in excess of   billion  considering the annual
potential sales  the estimated u  s  market size for retail postal  shipping  and
communication service is   billion  global
business services  inc  is the parent of postal
connections of america  which currently has  franchise locations sold or open in  states
and  area franchises  last year their franchise network grew
by   and sales of new stores jumped by    this year
the company is running ahead of that record pace and operating profitably 
one of the most compelling
reasons for our enthusiasm regarding the companys bright future is the fact
that many officers and
directors on the companys current management team were formerly with mbe and
were directly responsible for the incredible success of that company 
gbns shares are currently trading at a very undervalued
price of only      with a current market cap of
less than     million and its strong leadership and dynamic business model  we
firmly believe that the stock will significantly increase in value over the
coming months and years  this is an exciting  well  managed company that should prove to be highly
rewarding for loyal shareholders a grand slam homerun
