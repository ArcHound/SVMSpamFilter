cold november weather  with heating degree  days  percent above normal
through
the twenty  fifth  fueled withdrawals from storage that cera estimates will
average
approximately    billion cubic feet  bcf  per day for the month  near the
all  time
record for november set in   this is approximately    bcf per day higher
than
the previously expected withdrawal rate under normal weather conditions  the
result
is that storage inventories as of the end of the month are about  bcf
below the
year  earlier level and are on track to dip well into record low territory by
the end of
the winter  see table   
for december  normal weather would result in storage withdrawals of    bcf
per
day on average for the month  at that rate  storage inventories would fall
below   
trillion cubic feet  tcf  by the end of the year  the first time that has
ever occurred 
by the end of march cera expects working inventories to be reduced to  bcf
in
the united states  compared with the previous record low of  bcf 
this weather and high withdrawal rates have moved prices higher within the
wide
and volatile range between residual fuel oil and distillate  with gas prices
moving
farther above those of resid      to      and closer to the price of
distillate fuel
oil  approximately       strength in the oil market has kept the
resid  distillate
range high  but should gas test either boundary of this range  the price of
either
distillate or resid would move as well  under normal weather cera now expects
december prices to average     at the henry hub  a higher level within this
range
reflective of reduced storage inventories 
although prices have abated somewhat in recent days and will continue to rise
and
fall with weather and weather forecasts  fundamentals now are so tight that a
return
to cold weather would quickly drive prices back above     and potentially
above
    at the henry hub  it is only at that level or above that any significant
additional demand response is likely  and even then such a response would
require
time  the possibility of curtailments of interruptible loads late this winter
has grown 
while the possibility of significant price relief appears increasingly remote
