importance  high
i have an issue with this format  when you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up  we have run into this issue before  and that is why we have not put it in frames  we may need to look at another format to cover the on  line users and the customers that print this report  this has been an on going issue on  line when you scroll down you lose the header  the printing customers won  t think to highly of this format  my suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides  printing and viewing   jeff  perry  we may have to get together and discuss this issue

please go to http    twdev  ets  enron  com our testing site to view the modified tw unsubscribed capacity web page and see if this is what you guys want  i removed the borders because the table header and records page are in the different frames  it is very hard to adjust them exactly straight into the same columns 
thanks
