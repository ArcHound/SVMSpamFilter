Subject re  transwestern expansion
  proprietary  
michelle  thanks for sending this to me so quickly  i do have a couple more questions for you 
  what is the discount rate you will be using to calculate the npv in your open season 
  can an affiliate of a company also place a bid for up to the volume available to needles 
  how does the right of first refusal work 
for example  when we spoke earlier i think you used an example of a     bid for  year getting equal value as a    bid for  years  adjusted for npv  of course  and the winning party got a rofr   let  s say the  year bid won   at the end of the year  is the rofr calculated on the     value the shipper holds the transport at or is it based on current market conditions  let  s say the market value has collapsed and the market views this capacity as worth only     dth and the current shipper is willing to match that rate does that mean he can retain the capacity  then for what term  whatever the market bids that piece for or will there be a set time the  in years  that the holder of the capacity will have to match regardless of what the bidder bids 
i hope this example makes sense  if not  please give me a call to discuss at       
thanks for your help
