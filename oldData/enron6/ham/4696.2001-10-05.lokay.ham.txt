subject  amendment to ppl  
 for the term of this amendment  transwestern agrees to provide an additional discount to the shipper for quantities that could not be scheduled hereunder due to an event of force majeure  as reasonably determined by transwestern 
rendering the supplies unavailable  the additional discount will be an amount equal to any quantities made unavailable multiplied by the discounted rate  
this contract needs to be amended for the above paragraph  legal  maria pavlou  has already approved and ppl is expecting this change  thanks
