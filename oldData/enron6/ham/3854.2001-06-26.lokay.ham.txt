arizona warns of southwest capacity shortfall
california is not the only state worried about the adequacy of its gas pipeline infrastructure 
in recent correspondence with ferc  the arizona corporation commission urged federal
regulators to put california  s capacity shortage in a broader regional context  failure to do
so  the acc warned  might cause california  s gas supply problems to spread to other states 
 given the regional  multi  state nature of the interstate pipelines in the southwest  any
actions taken by the ferc to address california  s interstate pipeline system will have wide  spread
ramifications for arizona and a number of other states   said the acc 
as part of its effort to tackle california  s energy woes  ferc staff has been studying the
state  s pipeline infrastructure to see if there are ways to improve the delivery of gas  in may 
the commission hosted a conference devoted entirely to gas transportation issues in california
 gd      representatives from neighboring states also got involved 
in comments sent to ferc on june   the acc expressed concern that measures to
remedy california  s gas shortage might shift much  needed capacity away from its state  if
federal regulators do not press for the improvement of pipeline services throughout the south  west 
it might  lead to a worsening of regional problems and  or a shifting or spreading of
problems from california to arizona and other states   the acc argued 
in particular  the acc said that it was alarmed about the continued reliance of arizona shippers
on the el paso natural gas system  at present  two interstate pipelines  el paso and transwestern
pipeline  serve the state  but the bulk of arizona shippers only have access to the el paso system 
 the acc is becoming increasingly concerned with the pipeline capacity situation in
arizona and whether current natural gas shippers in arizona  with existing contract rights on
the el paso system  will receive reliable pipeline service in the future   wrote the commission 
 it is widely recognized that the el paso system running through arizona to california has
been operating at very high utilization rates recently  additionally  it appears that little or no
additional pipeline capacity will be added by el paso in the near future to serve existing cus  tomers
and their existing contract rights  beyond the line  expansion which will largely
replace capacity that has been lost for other reasons  
el paso recently won approval for line   which will boost deliverability into califor  nia
by as much as  million cfd  but despite efforts to add capacity  the pipeline has been
dogged by complaints about access to its system 
according to shippers in texas  arizona and new mexico  el paso has proposed a new
allocation scheme that would force captive shippers to pay more for access to its system  echoing
the comments of the acc  the shippers said they faced degradation of firm service rights because
of el paso  s diminished ability to deliver gas consistent with contractual obligations  gd     
ferc  in fact  is planning a technical conference next month to discuss the issues raised
by el paso  s latest allocation plan  the meeting is scheduled for july   but ferc allowed
that the meeting may continue through july  
the concerns of the acc may help shore up the assertions of east  of  california shippers 
contrasting the access that california shippers have to pipelines and storage facilities  the acc said 
 ferc should ensure that captive shippers are not disadvantaged due to their lack of options  
most importantly  said the acc  ferc should encourage capacity additions that serve the
needs of both existing shippers and expansion shippers   the complexity of the issues and the
potential for inadvertently exacerbating the region  s pipeline capacity problems argues for a
careful and thorough approach to the issues  ensuring that customers in arizona  california and
elsewhere in the region are well served by any change in the treatment of pipeline capacity in
the southwest   the acc concluded   plol    rpo     nh
