natural gas report   residential gas costs rising
residential costs for gas will rise this winter as the wholesale cost of
natural gas has doubled since last year  local distribution companies
will feel opposing pressures of reducing the impact on customers 
while recouping their costs 
 this is not a one  year phenomenon  wholesale prices are expected
to remain high through  
 rising gas prices were previously overshadowed by high heating
oil costs  but the spotlight will soon turn to gas as residential prices
could rise by  percent or more
