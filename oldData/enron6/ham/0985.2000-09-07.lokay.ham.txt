Subject eia  s latest forecast of pricing and supply for the winter
eia predicts supply shortfall will linger through winter
the energy information administration said yesterday in its september
short  term energy outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead
will increase by about   this winter  october  march  compared to last
winter  residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average by  
compared to last year  for the entire year  the average wellhead price for
natural gas is projected to be      mcf  the highest annual wellhead price
on record  in inflation  adjusted terms  it would be the highest annual
average price since   
the short  term supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry  s
ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are
likely to continue into the heating season  eia said  storage levels could
end up being about   below the five  year average of about    bcf by the
start of winter if net injections continue at   below historically average
rates through the remainder of the refill season 
the effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the
form of significantly increased production until after the next heating
season  according to the agency  s report 
 for now  we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible
increases in domestic gas production for  and   with assumed
increases of     and    respectively  for this year and next      the eia
report stated   on the other hand  the u  s  natural gas rig count on aug  
was at a recent high of  rigs  exploration and production budgets for many
natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply in  and  
spurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues
from producing assets  also on the positive side  data from the texas
railroad commission suggest that  through may  year  gas production
increased  if only slightly        this signifies a turnaround  however
modest  in a key producing region  very high gas drilling rates  including a
record  setting pace in deep offshore gulf of mexico  confirm that
increasingly positive results for domestic gas production are under way  
imports are projected to rise by about   next year primarily because of the
   bcf  d alliance pipeline coming on line next month 
meanwhile the demand outlook remains bullish at     annual growth  in  
however  the forecast has been revised downward to     growth because of
higher than expected natural gas prices  the industrial sector is the leading
sector for demand increases in  at      while electric utility demand is
expected to decline by     primarily because of power plant sales  for the
power generation sector as a whole  gas demand is expected to grow     this
year and     in   eia said the reduced growth rate next year is largely
due to the reversal in relative prices of fuel oil and natural gas  which
began in august  with fuel oil gaining the price advantage as gas prices
continued to rise 
gas demand this winter is expected to be up by     compared to last winter
if weather is normal  normal weather implies a   rise in heating
degree  days compared with last winter
