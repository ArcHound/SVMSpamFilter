subject  transwestern capacity release report for february  reservation invoices
attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for january  capacity release transactions  if you have any questions  please feel free to contact me 
fyi  based on the flash invoices i generated last night for the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts  please note the following 
ena k   res  manual rate adjustment is needed for the    split of marketing fees for capacity released to burlington
conoco k   res  delete the thoreau to e  thoreau line item
conoco k   comm  delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
texaco k     comm  when verifying fuel rate of     between the lateral and mainline contract sched volumes  there is a ldifference that could not be attributed to rounding  need to verify if difference is caused by makeup volumes  and if delivery makeup scheduled  then invoice should be adjusted accordingly 
please remember that the notes above are based on data as of       i will review again on the lst 
schedulers  please provide a final copy of the delivery tolerance report to both me and marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged  some contracts are based on calculations  especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage  

thanks 
elizabeth
