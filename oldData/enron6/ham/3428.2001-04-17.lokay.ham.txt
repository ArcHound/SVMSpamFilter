Subject archiving unsubscribed capacity
i spoke with perry frazier this afternoon  i have a copy in my file of the unsubscribed capacity on our ebb prior to the sale of tw space to mavrix and a copy of the sheet post  mavrix  yes the space was posted   perry is printing the capacity sheets daily  sometimes  
as a backup  michelle lokay will also do a daily print for years     and   the pages will be kept in a log book on the tw marketing desk for future reference 
let me know if you have questions 
thanks
