comprehensive settlement agreement
appendix b outlines the details of backbone transmission  receipt point capacity rights 
  all receipt points will be defined with firm capacity and primary access rights that reflect physical limitations  the appendix b table of receipt point capacity indicates that for no  needles  transwestern has primary access rights of  mmcf  d and mojave at hector road has secondary access rights 
  for interconnects into socalgas with more than one upstream pipeline  secondary access rights will be defined 
  new or expanded interconnects with existing or new pipelines will have secondary access rights only and will be subject to bumping by gas scheduled through primary access points 
in the text of the csa  the open season procedures for intrastate backbone transmission  receipt point capacity are described in detail  briefly  its proposed to work as follows 
  initial reservation for core customers  socalgas acquisitions  core transport agents and wholesale customers serving the core will be provided a set aside amount of capacity  this included  mmcf  d at north needles 
  first stage  phase i of the open season for   of rp capacity after deducting core customer set aside  existing noncore customers may bid on any rp capacity up to   of their historical usage 
  second stage  phase ii of the open season for remainder of phase i capacity  if any  not awarded or allocated  available to same existing noncore customers as in phase i to bid on in this second round if they haven  t been awarded capacity up to their   historical usage 
  third stage  phase iii of the open season for   of rp capacity after deducting core customer set aside plus any remaining capacity not awarded in phases i and ii  bidding open to any existing or new customers with creditworthiness established 
  socalgas will hold annual open seasons for expired or non  contracted available capacity 
  market concentration limits were set such that no person or entity including affiliates may hold more than   of the capacity  after core set aside  at any one receipt point awarded through the open season process  this does not include secondary market capacity or individually negotiated contracts acquired after the initial open season

system adequacy proceeding   lorenz testimony
lad lorenz testifies that the proposal to allocate firm receipt point capacity on the socalgas system is intended to be used  until the commission acts in the gir proceeding  
in section h  of lad  s testimony on firm receipt point access  table ii illustrates that north needles will be expanded by  mmcf  d to a level of   in table iii under the heading of firm primary access it states  tw   who then allocates among its shippers  in reference to the  mmcf  d of capacity listed for north needles 
in this same section h  lad states that this alternative proposal for allocating primary firm capacity at each receipt point will achieve improved reliability  until the commission acts to approve the csa  
cpuc decision      on socalgas unbundling
the commission approved the csa on dec     with certain modifications  these modifications included 
  market concentration limits were decreased from   to   and included capacity attained in subsequent open seasons or by individually negotiated contracts  secondary market capacity remains excluded from the market concentration limit 
  a secondary market price cap was established at   of the interruptible rate      
  reinstated the core reservation for intrastate capacity at  mmcf  d  csa lowered it to    this explains why the core reservation for needles is  and doesn  t match the tw  socal contract level  the additional  was allocated per a calpine proposal on a prorata basis to each receipt point with needles receiving an additional  mmcf  d 
in the summary and conclusion sections of the decision  socalgas was directed to include the additional  mmcf  d of new backbone and receipt point capacity in its open season  this part of the order did not provide any direction as to how the new capacity was to be allocated to upstream pipelines  additionally socalgas was directed to file an advice letter for implementation and to include proposed methods for allocating any additional future capacity additions
