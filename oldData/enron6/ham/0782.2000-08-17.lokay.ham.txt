terminability of val verde interconnect agreement
i  ve looked into whether we can terminate our val verde interconnect
agreement with burlington  and have determined we may do so only if we take
the following steps 
  terminate the oba by giving  days notice to burlington  paragraph 
of the      oba with burlington  as successor in interest to meridian 
provides that either party may terminate the oba  at the end of the primary
term  or thereafter by providing thirty    days prior written notice  to
burlington   the one  month primary term ended june    and has since
gone month  to  month  
  on the effective termination date of the oba  terminate the interconnect
agreement by giving  days notice to burlington  the     
interconnect point operating agreement  paragraph   provides that either
party may terminate on  prior notice after expiration of the primary
term  this is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire
until       however  the paragraph also provides that the agreement  may
be terminated by either party upon thirty    days prior written notice in
the event the oba between the parties is terminated  
as we  ve already discussed  termination of the agreement is an extreme
measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh
our other options first  let me know if you have further questions
