Subject tw electronic contracting filing
on february  th  the ferc approved tw  s electronic contracting filing to become effective march     we made the filing to correspond with the implementation of the new contracting system in market services  shippers can still contract via fax and in writing  however  they will now  i believe after this coming weekend  by able to do requests and contracting electronically  this include capacity release  there were a few minor changes in the shipper requests requirements  but i believe most of these were already occurring  we just updated the tariff language 
one change which is very different is that a service agreement must be signed and returned within  days instead of  days
