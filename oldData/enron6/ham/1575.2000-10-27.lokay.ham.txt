warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the focus
in the
gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growing
sense
that supplies might just prove adequate  the result has been a steady and
steep
decline in the november nymex price from     per mmbtu on october  into
the     s as of october   cash prices have followed suit  falling from the
mid 
    s to the     s at the henry hub  and gas is now pricing below residual
fuel oil
in the gulf coast and especially on the east coast  although gas storage
inventories
will begin the winter at levels higher than expected  in cera   s view adequate
supply for the winter is not yet assured  and the market remains subject to a
quick
return to prices well above     with the first cold snap 
storage injections of  billion cubic feet  bcf  for the week ended october

accompanied by broad  based and continuing warm weather have driven the shift
in
market psychology  last week   s injection rate was    bcf  or approximately
  
bcf per day  above the previous five  year average for those seven days and 
bcf
above the  bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending october
 
with warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures
expected
next week  cera now expects storage to reach a maximum level of    bcf on
october    still an all  time low entering the winter  by  bcf  see table
  
is this inventory level  enough   not yet  storage inventories this winter
under  
year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately  bcf   bcf
above
the previous all  time low  this end  of  march minimum implies total
withdrawals in
the united states this winter of    trillion cubic feet  tcf    bcf above
last year   s
withdrawals  but holding withdrawals this winter down to    tcf in the face
of a
return to normal weather   and the demand rebound of    bcf per day it would
bring   will be difficult  although the beginning of a us supply rebound and
growing imports will add approximately    bcf per day to supplies this
winter 
holding withdrawals down requires both of the following 
 industrial markets   mainly ammonia and methanol
producers   that are now shut down because of high gas prices
must remain shut down  these markets represent
approximately    bcf per day of demand that could return 
should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol 
 the nearly    bcf per day of switchable load now burning
residual fuel oil must remain off of gas 
in cera   s view  for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis 
particularly
as power loads increase this winter  it must become apparent that winter
demand can
be met  the current resid load can return to gas  and storage inventories can
be held
reasonably near the previous record low  that low   bcf  occurred in march

and was accompanied by a february average price of     and a march average
of
    at the henry hub  that spring  however  us productive capability was
nearly
   bcf per day greater than it is today  winter power generation demand was
lower 
and there were about    million fewer residential and commercial gas
customers in
the united states 
market fundamentals in cera   s view still support gas prices above those of
resid 
which as of this writing is pricing in the          per mmbtu range  warm
weather throughout november and into december could reverse this
relationship  but
a warm october alone is insufficient  and any cold weather within the next few
weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the
market 
cera   s price outlook for november   an average of     at the henry hub  
stands for now
