midwest markets  northern border pipeline has released plans to build a new
  mile greenfield pipeline from mccabe  mt  to gillette  wy  to tap the
rapidly growing production in the powder river  which is estimated to hold
between  and  tcf of gas 
the basin  s rapid production growth has captured the attention of the
industry  with numerous proposed pipelines  including several new interstate
plans that would bring gas to the midcontinent gas grid  northern border  s
project  called the bison pipeline  would add a new route out of the basin
for between    and    mmbtu  d of production starting in november

receipt points are proposed with bighorn  fort union gas gathering  migc and
thunder creek gas services  a bi  directional interconnect accessing williston
basin interstate pipeline  s baker storage field also is proposed

direct access to several local distribution companies  including

demand rate cuts  cents off that  the pipeline is offering
 mileage  sensitive rates   which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor
supply access and optimize transportation value
