Subject broad update on el paso system
el paso south system flows  mmcf  d
less than two weeks after the deadly explosion on el paso natural gas  system
in southeastern new mexico  the pipeline last week had more than  mmcf  d
of its    bcf  d capacity restored to its south mainline that services
markets between texas and california 
at mid  day friday  el paso said it began running about  mmcf  d through
line  after it received the go  ahead from the federal office of pipeline
safety  ops   according to spokeswoman kim wallace  el paso was able to
re  start partial service on the   inch line after it built a   inch
temporary connector line between line  and line   which was approved
by ops 
the temporary connector was installed just east of the pecos river explosion
site  about  miles from carlsbad  nm  wallace said line  would carry
the gas from eunice  nm  just northeast of the pecos river compressor
station  to the connector with line   which then would transport it
westward across the pecos river bridge where it would meet up with line 
further downstream  meanwhile  wallace said el paso submitted to ops last
week the test results and a preliminary return  to  service plan for line  
three days prior  the ops had given el paso permission to restore service to
line  from the keystone station through the pecos river compressor
station at a reduced level  the pipeline re  opened the line at about 
mmcf  d  and gradually increased it to  mmcf  d by friday  this is  still
within the limits it  ops  set  for line   wallace said 
the ops restricted el paso  s line  to   of the operating pressure of
line  at the time it ruptured  according to department of transportation
spokeswoman debbie hinz  she said this put the line at a pressure of about
 pounds per square inch 
the ops  ordered shutdown of line  lasted  days  during which the agency
ordered el paso to conduct extensive hydrostatic  ultrasound and x  ray tests
to determine its safety  and to submit a plan for restoring service to the
line 
as for the future of ruptured line   wallace said repairs on it would not
begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed  which will
 probably be nine to  months  
the restoration of service couldn  t come soon enough for el paso customers
who have been scrambling for transportation capacity ever since federal
investigators and regulators closed down the three lines that make up el
paso  s south main leg in the wake of the blast that killed  people and
critically injured one  california customers have been taking gas out of
storage to meet their needs during the service interruption  the department
of energy has set up a task force to evaluate the effects of the explosion
and shutdown on the gas market
