rather than enjoying a respite  western energy markets will make november
a catch  up month  natural gas demand will remain high when compared with
the same period last year  as gas  fired generation will continue to run at
high
utilization rates and market participants try to restore gas storage to normal
levels  the tight supply situation will maintain upward pressure on gas
prices  which will range from     to     per million british thermal
units  depending on location  refueling outages at three nuclear units  along
with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output  will maintain gas  fired
generation on the margin for most of november  on  peak power prices will
remain higher as a result  in the      per megawatt  hour range 
depending on location
