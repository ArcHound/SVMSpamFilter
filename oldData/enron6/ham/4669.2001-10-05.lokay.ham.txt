weakening demand to put the squeeze on spot refining margins
oil demand growth is slowing dramatically in the aftermath of the september 
terrorist attacks  the combination of sluggish gdp growth and a sharp decrease
in commercial air travel will in cera  s view result in declines in quarterly
oil demand in fourth quarter  and first quarter   spot refining margins
are expected to trend downward  with the possibility of periods of upward
volatility  key factors that will influence the path of margins for the balance
of this year and into  include
 weakening supply  demand fundamentals  as weak economies and reduced
commercial air travel drive down demand
 opec production policy and its effect on inventory levels
 supply security concerns  including perceived risks of disruptions to
physical supply that could result from new attacks or military action
