subject  ferc conference on el paso capacity allocation  rpo    
summary
though this conference was scheduled to review all issues related to el paso  s capacity allocation method  including those in the pipeline  s order  proceeding   and with two complaints filed this summer regarding problems with the pipeline  s allocation  major substantive issues were not covered at this conference  for instance  the battle between full requirements  fr  shippers and contract demand  cd  shippers came up marginally  but not in terms as substantive as the proposed conversion of fr shippers to cd contracts 
procedurally  there was also no decision on whether to proceed with a hearing  merits decision from the commission or settlement  though it looks like a merits decision is the likely avenue for a decision  staff did not discuss case merits or ask pointed substantive questions 
allocation studies  models 
el paso opened the conference with a presentation  interpretation of seven capacity studies they have done to illustrate how its allocation proposal  march   would allocate the system  s receipt and delivery points based on different scenarios  for nominations  receipt and delivery points were specified and ranked by shippers  and the model used  pools  the scheduling model looked at where constraints occurred  based on those shipper  supplied preferences   solved the largest constraints first  then ran second and third iterations to complete allocation 
there were questions on the studies  what they show  what the assumptions are  etc   and in the end shippers believe they need information not shown by the completed studies  shippers have requested six more allocation studies  showing possible impacts of seasonalization  winter and summer  and the difference between cd and full requirements coincidental and non coincidental peaks  winter and summer      
el paso interprets its studies as showing that the proposed capacity allocation method is workable  and in fact results in  mmcf  d of unallocated capacity   mmcf coming from the line  expansion proposal  and an extra  mmcf   shippers were skeptical of the  slack capacity  finding 
other issues
 pooling  there was a small amount of discussion on the impact of moving from six to  pools  it was noted that this should be addressed with order  issues  expeditiously after capacity allocation method is resolved 
 fr vs  cd  though there were some fr vs  cd shippers discussions  they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by the tx  nm and az shippers  fr  and aera energy  cd shippers   there was also no mention of converting fr shippers to cd service  note  never mentioned were the cd and fr complainants  proposals that el paso    dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or    requiring mainline system expansion for existing service  rpol   and   
 release shippers  shippers contracting for released capacity were concerned about how they would be allocated  as well as those shippers picking up turnback contracts from the pipeline  which would have receipt and delivery points already allocated  
 receipt point designation  the question was asked if shippers could designate specific receipt points rather than pools  when asked what commission policy is on pools vs  receipt points  both shippers and staff clarified that they are neither mutually exclusive nor to serve as substitutes for one another  both should be available  however  staff noted that in the flexibility vs  reliability debate  it could be argued that el paso should return to receipt point designation to maintain reliability 
procedure going forward
the primary issue here ended up being procedural
