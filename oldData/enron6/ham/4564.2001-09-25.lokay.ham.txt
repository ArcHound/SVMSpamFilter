weak oil fundamentals weighing on price
two forces are vying for control of oil market psychology since september   
fear of recession and fear of military action  currently  the fear of recession
and its implications for oil demand is in ascendance because military action
remains in preparatory mode thus far 
 an escalation of military action would revive the initial concerns that a us
military response could affect production in the middle east 
 the terrorist attack of september  is delivering a shock to the us economy
with ramifications in the oil market  cera has revised downward sharply its
demand outlook in the wake of the attacks 
 opec producers are also growing more concerned about market share  our
outlook assumes that opec does not agree to a further cut at its september 
meeting in vienna
