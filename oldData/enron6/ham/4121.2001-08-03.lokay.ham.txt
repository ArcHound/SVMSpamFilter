ec  i got a call from mike abbott today and the building is ready to go 
do you know if michelle has an agreement made or any  for this material 
or  should we have this shipped to them on a  good faith  basis 
in the previous attached memo  i told eog that i would let them know
when the building is ready  so i owe them a call as soon as i find out how
enron wants me to handle the material  if you want me to call michelle
directly  i can do that  too  just let me know  thanks and have a great
weekend
