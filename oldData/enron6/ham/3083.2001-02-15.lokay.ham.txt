subject  tw expansion
there were several questions left for legal  regulatory to work on at the close of our meeting today  i  ll try to restate them  and add my initial thoughts  so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems 
q   can tw use  negotiated rate  agreements for its new  mm  d expansion 
a  yes  independence  guardian  and other new pipeline projects were certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts  the only restriction is that we need to always offer cost  based recourse rate service as an alternative to negotiated rates  we hope to use negotiated rate agreements for the entire  mm of capacity  but we won  t know until the contracts are executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it will be under recourse rate contracts  i guess that means that in the cert  app   we just tell the commission that we will be   at risk and that given the huge interest in the open season  we have no doubts about our ability to sell the full   we should also tell the commission we expect to sell the capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a combination of both 
q   can we give prospective customers a  cafeteria style  menu of options  to steal jeff  s term   like the following 
   yr  neg  rate deal at a locked in    plus fuel and surcharges  or whatever number we decide on 
   y  neg  rate deal at a locked in    plus fuel and surcharges
   yr  neg rate deal at a locked in    blah blah
   yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges  importantly this option is not locked in and will float with tw  s actual rate levels and fuel retainage percentages 
a  i think the answer here is  yes   whatever options we come up with for     and   we will always have to offer  as well  susan and steve stojic  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated rate options and stick to them  otherwise  this negotiated rate approach could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations  like a  yr   day contract at     for example   i  m not sure that would be a bad thing  but we need to think about it  we need to be sure we can tell a customer  no  and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for the  yr term and the    rate  for example  i think we can lay out options of our choosing and then enforce a  no substitutions  policy  this is sticking with the  cafeteria  theme  but we need to be sure 
q    if we can use the  cafeteria options  approach  how much flexibility do we have in structuring the options 
a  this one is hard  we need to be sure that the price and term we choose to offer for options    is solely within our discretion  we don  t want to be second guessed by ferc as to whether we should have offered option  at    instead of     susan and steve  if you guys confirm that we have discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options  does that mean we can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better deal than the recourse option  for most shippers   i  e   could we deliberately incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals   i  e   by offering options    at        and    instead of the         and    shown above  i suspect that is what guardian and the other pipes did to obtain   subscription under neg  rate deals 
q    how do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply   
a  ideally  we  d be able to allocate the  to the guys who want to buy it the way we  d prefer to sell it  under the above example  assuming stan  danny and steve decide short term deals are better  what if we get  mm  d of offers on each of the  rate  term options described above  that  s  mm  d of demand for a  mm  d project  can we sell  to the guys who want option        yrs  and the remaining  to the  yr     guys  that really hoses the recourse bidders  do we have to cover the recourse demand first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else  pro rata to everyone  under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation  pro rata to everyone may be the right answer  or at least its the answer until we  ve filled the recourse rate guys  orders  then we can give the remaining capacity to the neg  rate guys whose bids we value most highly  using some objective nondiscriminatory calculation of course   ugh 
susan and steve   please take a crack at questions     i think  is answered already  i haven  t done any research yet  so maybe these questions are easier than they currently seem to me  get me and mkm on the phone at your convenience to discuss  we  ve gotta move quick so the marketers can get out and sell this stuff  df
