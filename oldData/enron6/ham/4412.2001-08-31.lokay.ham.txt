to all 
i was very optimistic in my target of getting the level b estimate ready by sept  
based on the amount of work that will need to be done to get a decent      estimate  i agree with norm  s assessment and therefore the best we can hope for is a sept    completion 
we will endeavor to do our best 
thank you

a preliminary model has been developed based on the limited information doug  kevin  and i discussed yesterday  a finished product won  t be complete until such time as elevations are verified along the new pipeline route  topogaphical maps are required to complete this portion of the study  once this is completed and studies run  that product will be reviewed by the planning team and system optimization team  studies will be based on the results of the open season and the volumes anticipated by marketing  expansion facilities will be adjusted based on those results and finished porduct produced

we have a procedure in place with planning that any level b estimates that are major expansion projects  such as this  require at least one month to complete  after we have a defined scope of work from planning 
kevin  we realize your goals  but for us to do a proper level b with all of our due diligences  it won  t be ready before sept   th  at the earliest  especially if the hydraulics  which are part of the scope  aren  t done until after sept   th from planning  thanks  norm

i  ll need to fly the routes and assess the terrain conditions  i plan to do this on sept  matthews  ron

guys  we  ll need to get the level  b  cost estimates put together as soon as possible in order to send out binding contracts to customers  i can  t comfortably send out binding contracts with transportation rates still dependent upon a deeper project cost analysis  please let me know at your earliest convenience what your timing is for the level b 
thanks

based on scaling the topo maps i have  the following are the lengths for each of the segments we discussed 
transwestern mainline    loop
compressor station   to el paso take off point     miles or say  miles
new lateral    or  
a compressor station   to phoenix storage cavern along i   highway route   miles    contingency or say  miles
b el paso take off point to phoenix storage cavern along el paso pipeline route   miles    contingency or say  miles
in summary  the new lateral using the el paso route is  miles shorter in what appears to be easier terrain  but will require the  mile extension on the transwestern loop 
i will flly both routes on sept  and examine any other options from the air 
i will drive as much of the routes as i can on sept  and evaluate on the ground the soil  rock conditions 
after this asessement  we can zero in on the most cost effective option and route to pursue 
call me if you have any questions
