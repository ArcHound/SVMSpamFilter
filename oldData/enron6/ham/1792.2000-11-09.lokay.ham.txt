kim 
you might want to get on the distribution of this report  i have wondered
and asked the question  do we always cover variable operating costs on our
park and ride deals   a ride can have a very negative impact on fuel use 
doesn  t the deal analysis cover park  ride deals  you might want to check
into this 
thanks         terry
