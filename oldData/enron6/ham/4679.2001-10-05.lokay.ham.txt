california regulators suspend direct access to competiive energy suppliers
california  once considered a harbinger of retail electricity deregulation  is
reversing its previous efforts to create a competitive market for electricity 
suspending direct access is the latest   though probably not the final   event in
an ongoing series of developments and unique conditions that has made
deregulation a rocky road for players in the california market 
 this decision should not be interpreted as a rejection of the merits of
retail competition  but rather understood as a decision peculiar to the events
in california that have unfolded over the past  months 
 the ruling was motivated by the state  s need to provide a stable investment
environment to support its impending     billion bond offering to cover
energy related costs 
 the demise of retail competition in california may delay other states 
efforts to open their markets  however  most states face a very different power
generation situation  practically ensuring that events in california will not
be repeated in their markets 
 from a market perspective this may actually be an ideal time to push forward
with retail choice programs  as many markets move into surplus capacity
situations
