per our conversation today  transwestern pipeline and pg  e trading can wait until after the upcoming holidays to discuss pg  e  s right of first refusal on the    mmbtu per day that is currently posted  in fact  section   h  of transwestern  s fts   rate schedule indicates that transwestern could wait until july    to notify pg  e trading as to the terms of the best offer  pg  e trading would then have two weeks to notify transwestern of its desire to match  i  however  suggest that we begin discussions of the outcome of the posting sometime in january 
i hope that your holiday season is everything you are hoping it will be  merry christmas and happy new year 
best regards
