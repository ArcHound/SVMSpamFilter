Subject re  tw agreements
hi michelle 
i am assuming that  like most it agreements  we can put a base agreement in
place and then negotiate short  term discounts when available from time to
time  last time i talked to t  k  about this capacity it was discounted to
like a penny or    pennies   one of the reasons that we  ve never gotten
anything accomplished here is that we alway  s seem to be doing in the middle
of bid  week 
so  if we can  i  d like bryan to work with you immediately to begin the base
agreement processing  ok 
thanks 
scott
