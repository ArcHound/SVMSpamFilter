raymond james sends chills up gas buyers  spines
raymond james and associates gave gas buyers a halloween shriek yesterday
that could be producing chills all the way through next april  perhaps even
all of next year  the firm released a chilly forecast of double digit gas
prices this winter and said it expects prices to average      mmbtu in  
 regardless of a potentially warm winter  it is highly likely that the united
states will experience regional shortfalls in gas supply   raymond james said
in its latest energy report   in other words  gas storage should test
all  time low levels this winter regardless of weather 
 the situation should get worse  not better  next year  if we end the winter
at all  time low storage levels and we cannot inject more gas next summer than
we did this summer  then we should enter next winter with dangerously low
levels of natural gas   raymond james added 
 we believe that the united states will see gas demand increase by about 
bcf  d  or    by the end of  as new gas fired electric generation plants
come on line  unfortunately  even if every drilling rig is working  u  s  gas
supply is likely to increase by less than  bcf  d by the end of   this
means that gas prices must rise sufficiently to crimp over  bcf  d of demand
out of the gas supply  demand equation by   at    mcf  only about   
bcf  d of demand has been reduced so far  that means that gas prices must go
higher over the next several years  
however  raymond james  bullish predictions are a far cry above the crowd on
wall street  plenty of other analysts have upped their forecasts recently to
hair  raising levels  the first call consensus for  now is up to
     mmbtu  but that  s still  cents less than the raymond james  s
prediction 
not everyone wants to scare the daylights out of buyers  however  deutsche
bank believes analysts and the futures market participants at nymex  are
getting bold and in our view maybe too bold  
 with the natural gas rig count approaching   it is hard to believe that
there will not be a fairly substantial supply response in    deutsche
bank said in its energy wire on friday   analysts at the u  s  energy
information administration are expecting dry gas production to rise to   
tcf     bcf  d  in   after being stuck at near    tcf     bcf  d  for
several years  our own estimate for  looks for    tcf     bcf  d  and
we have seen credible forecasts reaching as high as    tcf   bcf  d   in
general we think the eia is way too conservative and that our own number is
more likely to be adjusted higher rather than lower  a gain in domestic
production of  bcf  d to    bcf  d could be doable  imports appear likely to
be up    bcf  d  if demand rises by      that would account for about a   
bcf  d gain  all other things equal  this implies that storage can refill and
suggests that prices are going to come under some downward pressure
