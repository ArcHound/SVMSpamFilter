along the same lines  we could possibly do an efbh deal with brt for a portion of their     d sj  eot deal  dp  s to wtx   again  i  m sure they would argue the obligation to flow warrents a reduction in their rate  but we could look at the economics compared to the cost of facility modifications  over the last year  brt hasn  t scheduled less than     d on average under that agreement

what if we could contract with agave under the efbh rate schedule for gas from red bluff  bitter lakes  located north of wt    south of p    to deliveries off the south end of the wtx lateral  then we could sell westward capacity through wt   under rate schedule fts    agave nominates a total of     d to     d from these supply sources into the central pool  but this gas does not need to flow through wt    maybe agave  s existing     d east could be done under efbh  if agave didn  t want to commit to incremental firm   but they would have the obligation to flow  i  m sure they would think that merits a rate adjustment  anyway  it could be cheaper than some of the options we discussed yesterday or it could be something we would want to do in addition to modifications to wt    for red rock  pnm deals  
kevin  let  s get together monday so i can fill you in on the status of wt   capacity
