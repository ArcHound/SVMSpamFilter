upon receipt of a notice to exercise rofr  you must determine the criteria of when the notice is required  in the example provided i  m told it required a one year notice therefore if the contract terminated       notice was due       therefore  days after      the capacity must be posted for bidding  in the interim  since it has not yet been posted a transaction could be negotiated and the shipper would then be required to provide notice of resinding the original election to participate in the rofr process  if this isn  t clear  please call mk
