kim 
here  s the november park and ride activity with it  s associated rates and
revenues  you might find some opportunities here to use the tw deal analysis
tool  maybe its morgan or tk lohmann who could use this tool to set p  r
rates to ensure we cover the varialble o  m costs  as you can see there  s not
much revenue associated with p  r during the course of the month so the impact
on linepack and fuel use has the potential to exceed the benefits 
thanks         terry
