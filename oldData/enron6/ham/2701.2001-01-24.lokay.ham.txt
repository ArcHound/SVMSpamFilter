 dave 

 attached is a proposal for firm transportation services that provide
 economic incentives to encourage sps to build a lateral from the nichols
 plant in potter co  tx to our transwestern panhandle lateral 

 as we have discussed  the proposal allows flexibility for receipt and
 delivery  yet provides rate assurance 

 thanks for your help  and if you have any questions please give me or
 michelle a call 

 sincerly 

 bob
