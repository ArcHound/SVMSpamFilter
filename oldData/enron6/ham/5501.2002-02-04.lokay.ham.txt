there is a great concern from tw planning  marketing that the existing cas system is not responding to our expectations 
while we have corrected numerous bugs in the program  getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow 
this has caused a delay from facility planning to the marketing group  lets plan to talk about some new features that marketing
has requested for the cas system  pipeline facility planning is arranging a meeting on friday feb   from  to    pm in
room   to discuss the concerned issues 
regards
