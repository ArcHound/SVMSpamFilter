Subject sun devil fuel
ben and ron  
following up on our meeting today  i need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our sun devil project  how much  if any  can i discount the fuel charges for sun devil shippers  based on the following assumptions 
project cost   mm
include all compression adds  mods from doug cebryk engineering scope dated     
incremental volume mmbtu  d     san juan     mainline     to phoenix     to cal border
of      total capacity to cal border and    to phoenix  assume    has to come from east of thoreau
assume load factors in   increments from   west flow up to   
assume fuel collection of   from shippers
in theory  we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for sun devil  and the new compressors at stations    are more efficient  then the actual fuel use should be less  please verify this for the load factors above  if we can keep the same net fuel retainage  but collect less because our actual fuel use is less  then this is a win  win for both tw and the sun devil shippers 
is an answer possible by tuesday    
thanks
