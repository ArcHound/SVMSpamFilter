pancanadian says montana power purchase  beautiful fit 
to extend what it sees as dominance in canada  s natural gas market and to
boost its production by    pancanadian petroleum ltd  yesterday agreed to
purchase montana power co  for   million  the properties will extend
pancanadian  s existing shallow gas properties in southern alberta into
northern montana  adding  mmcf  d and    barrels of crude oil and natural
gas liquids 
the acquisition will give pancanadian properties in alberta  montana 
colorado  oklahoma and wyoming  along with three gas pipelines linking
alberta and saskatchewan to montana 
 we have a focus on natural gas   said ceo david tuer during a conference
call yesterday in calgary   this is clearly our future  it is difficult to
put any negative on this  acquisition  and it  s likely to stay valuable for
the foreseeable future  
montana power  s production is more than   natural gas and associated
liquids  and the acquisition substantially extends pancanadian  s land and
infrastructure  allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in
a region that extends along the alberta  montana border 
 the montana power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ
our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth
natural gas   tuer said   the potential in these assets is significant  and
over the next few years  we will add substantially to pancanadian  s daily
natural gas production  
tuer said that the acquisition extends the company  s dominance in shallow
gas  and called montana power a  beautiful fit with pancanadian  s gas
strategy  land position and technological capability  
pancanadian  s newest acquisition adds reserves of  bcf and  mm barrels
of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and one  half probable basis  said
officials  production and reserves account for   million of the purchase
price  while the remainder is made up of   million for the midstream and
marketing assets    million for the undeveloped land  about    acres  
and   million of working capital 
tuer said the company was paying  cents  mcfe of proven and on  half probable
reserves  the price for daily flowing production  based on a    ration of
gas to boe is      mcfe  or      boe 
along with the added alberta and montana properties  pancanadian also picks
up some land in colorado  s denver basin  which now produces about  mmcf  d 
other land that is part of the sale is located in the anadarko basin of
oklahoma and the green river basin of wyoming 
three natural gas pipelines that cross from montana into alberta and
saskatchewan also are included  the pipelines allow direct access to the u  s 
markets for southern alberta and saskatchewan gas  and serve more than   
million net acres of developed and undeveloped lands  with most of it
concentrated in parcels that span the canada  montana border 
midstream assets that go to pancanadian include a natural gas marketing
company in butte  mt  along with a deep cut gas processing and fractionation
plant in colorado  the fort lupton  co plant processes more than  mmcf  d
and    barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate 
in all  the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly    million net
acres  or    million gross acres  said pancanadian 
 montana power fit us like a glove   tuer said during the conference call  he
said the acquisition will help pancanadian to remain  best of class  for what
it does   it makes our sandbox that much bigger  
the acquisition  which is expected to close around oct    will increase
both pancanadian  s net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent
years  said tuer  the added gas production will immediately increase the
company  s natural gas  as a percentage of total production  to    based on
a    ratio of gas to boe 
about   of the natural gas being acquired from montana power now is being
sold to montana power utilities for     to     mmcf until july   and
because it  s priced below the open market officials think future earnings
will be good 
 as that contract expires  there  s a lot of potential from the price in this
transaction   tuer said 
and what  s to become of montana power  earlier this year  the   year  old
company  headquartered in butte  announced it would divest itself of four of
its traditional energy businesses  by selling its coal production  natural
gas transmission and distribution  independent power production and oil and
gas exploration and production businesses  it plans to reinvest the proceeds
in touch america  a fiber optics and telecommunications business  which is
also a subsidiary of montana power 
 the process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust 
and we are delighted with the result   said montana power ceo robert p 
gannon   we believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that
cultural synergy  s exist between the purchased companies and pan canadian  
he noted that montana power has had a canadian presence for almost  years 
pancanadian purchased the entire oil and gas division  which now employs
about   pancanadian plans to maintain a regional office in butte  invest
in the acquired properties and grow daily gas production  there was no word
on whether any jobs would be lost
