subject  waiver of price cap on capacity release
fyi
i have been in several discussions lately where the statement has been made that waiver of the price cap on capacity release expires in september   this is incorrect  order  states that the commission is waiving the maximum rate ceiling in its capacity release regulations until september    for short  term releases of capacity of less than one year beginning upon the effective date of this rule 
 i  waiver of maximum rate ceiling  until september     the maximum rate ceiling does not apply to capacity release transactions of less than one year  with respect to releases of  days or less under paragraph  h   the requirements of paragraph  h     will apply to all such releases regardless of the rate charged
