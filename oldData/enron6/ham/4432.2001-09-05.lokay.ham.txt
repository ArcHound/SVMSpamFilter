Subject fw  switch tw rate type flags
i just spoke with elizabeth brown and she said the agreements have been  intentionally  billed as   part  knowing they are actually   part agreements  billing as a   part would require a significant amount on manual intervention on the commodity paths by the gas logistics group  this   part process has been used for these agreements for quite some time  it is unlikely we would change the billing method at this point but are willing to discuss further if you desire
