february demand was    percent over february  levels  and march demand
grew a further    percent above the previous year  the industrial sector
continued to lead the recovery with year  to  date demand growing    percent
over   and commercial sector demand growth remained strong at    percent
over a similar period  as demand growth strengthened  hydro power generation
increased while thermal generation levels declined steadily from a peak in
january  hydro stored energy levels had begun to decline in all regions by
the end of april  signaling the end of the wet season  with rapidly
increasing demand  particularly in the south and southeast regions  brazil
could experience power shortages during the coming dry season if capacity
additions that are currently scheduled to come online in the next several
months are delayed

for the first time in many decades  the presidential and parliamentary
campaigns are highly competitive  and the results of these democratically
conducted elections will have a large impact on the effectiveness and future
of the new administration  however  the real political battle begins after

the country is no closer to peace  and resolution of the ongoing negotiations

summary 
prices in the argentine power market were significantly higher in may owing
to the combination of continued low hydro output  strong demand growth  and
periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the buenos
aires region  spot power prices  energy component only  averaged     per
megawatt  hour  mwh  in may  although average power prices declined from last
year  price volatility increased  with several short  duration episodes of
prices over   per mwh as gas unavailability in the buenos aires region
forced several midcost units offline during peak hours  in june  prices are
expected to continue strengthening to the      per mwh range on average 
beyond june  price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing
hydro output  new and returning low  cost thermal capacity  and the end of gas
constraints push average prices back toward   per mwh or below by august or

the us gas market enters the month of june with prices at the highest level
since deregulation  at the henry hub prices have surged to as high as    
per mmbtu   up from less than     per mmbtu during april  behind this has
been a building and serious shortfall of supply  the result of disappointing
gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation  the gap
between these two forces has been met through storage inventories  with
injections so far this spring running between    and    bcf per day below
last year  s rate  the continued tension between these two forces will keep
the pressure on prices this summer  and the need to inject gas into storage
will price out increments of demand

pressure remains extremely strong in the united states gas market as three
factors   the increasing power generation demand  lower storage inventories 
and us wellhead supply still struggling to rebound   call into question the
ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter  prices are
being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets 
making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent
years  in this environment intense competition between power generation
demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer   with
pressure increasing into july as temperatures rise   with the result that gas
will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end  use

summary 
as us supply declines and demand grows  current high gas prices are
reinforced  but western canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering
when it is needed most  both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie
the disappointing production growth results  the largely weather  related
transitory factors have had a near  term impact on drilling and connection
activity  the underlying trends have been developing slowly over time  more
shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and
created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well
production rates  thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace
production  with a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling  higher
supply growth rates are possible  but if that does not occur  other potential
supply sources may step in  significant arctic reserves in the mckenzie delta
and the alaskan north slope are once again entering the spotlight  coal bed
methane has become a str 
ong source of us supply  although now ignored in canada  it may become a
future source of canadian gas

summary 
fundamentals have taken center stage  as building demand pressure accompanies
us supply declines  storage inventories have been significantly reduced  and
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into
the summer months  demand  driven growth continues  as completions of
gas  fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above    megawatts
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand  the result is a
higher  price playing field for natural gas  with the average henry hub price
likely to reach     per mmbtu for    its highest level since the
development of spot markets

the stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility
industry  traditionally undervalued in the market  the sector is trading at a
historically wide  percent discount to standard and poor  s s  p   the s  p
utility index over the past  months gained only  percent  with huge gains
by some energy companies offset by a  percent drop in stock price for 
electric utilities  yet early this year  the spu outpaced all other industry
groups  how should constantly evolving utilities in this wide  open sector
form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success 
the value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for    a record
  billion   was double the  value  but are these choices ahead of the
curve  and when will the market catch up  three groups of new companies with
distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape 
multiservice and technology providers  superregionals  and global power and 
energy companies  three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating
responses to these challenges

summary 
while several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price
spikes this summer  other markets are likely to see a reversal in price
volatility as supply  demand balances improve dramatically  one way to
interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations 
therefore  forward prices for on  peak wholesale power reflect the common
expectation that prices will spike as high as   or even higher than   in  
a significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market
fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets

gasoline  to  crude oil price differentials on both sides of the north atlantic

this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors

summary 
as higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials
to brent and thus lower refinery margins  refiners attempted to prevent this
situation from worsening by reducing throughputs  however  very tight markets
for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the
fall in those products  values  meanwhile  fuel oil discounts to crude oil
widened in may  driving down simple  hydroskimming margins 
in recent weeks  the combination of lower primary products inventories and
reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to
recover  this has pushed margins to above may  s averages  although still
below april  s peaks

summary 
refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences  in
the atlantic basin  low gasoline inventories in both the united states and
europe  which resulted from many months of opec production restraint 
continue to dominate the market  and gasoline differentials above crude are
at their highest level in over ten years  although signs are emerging of a
possible correction in the north american market in the coming month  the
 gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by
atlantic basin refiners in many years  in contrast  asia pacific spot
refining margins were weak through most of june  until the recent accident at
kpc  s mina al  ahmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt
singapore margins  however  with ample unused refining capacity available
east of suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the kpc refinery in
july  cera  s outlook is for that strength to be of short duration

summary 
in the west  july typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and
steadily rising power prices  cera expect the west to be the only region in
north america with a year  over  year increase in peak electricity demand 
power prices already established new record highs in june  suggesting that as
demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will
continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year  s levels 
the convergence of higher gas prices  growing power demand  and reduced
hydroelectric energy production compared with  levels is pushing up
western power prices  greater utilization of gas  fired generators within the
west has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices
throughout north america  western gas prices should continue to be strong 
boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation
and pressure across north america to inject gas into storage in anticipation

opec  s agreement to raise its production quota beginning july  by   
barrels per day to    million barrels per day is consistent with its
strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low
levels  the gain in supply is a short  term fix meant to alleviate political
pressure for increased production and to push prices below   but keep them
in a mid  to upper   s range
