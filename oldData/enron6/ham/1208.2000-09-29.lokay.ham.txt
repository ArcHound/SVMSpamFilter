                                                         cooler temperatures
and lower energy demand in the west have driven daily power prices below  
per megawatt hour  mwh   the summer brought the region  s strongest sustained
power and gas markets in recent history  for fall and winter  cera expects
western spot power and gas prices to be higher and more volatile than in past
years  with october on  peak power prices at       per mwh and winter
prices around       per mwh  depending on location  august  s el paso
pipeline explosion intensified the summer  s supply bottlenecks  although
service on the southern system was quickly restored  the supply disruption
affected storage inventories  with a heavy summer draw in california
weakening already dwindling inventories  for two weeks  pipeline capacity
limits on el paso  s pipe into california pushed topock differentials to
nearly     per mmbtu  and the access constraint intensified downward
pressure on rocky mountain 
and san juan prices  the topock differential fell back last week after
averaging over     per mmbtu for most of september  the rush to inject
storage inventories ahead of heating season should limit further declines in
that differential
