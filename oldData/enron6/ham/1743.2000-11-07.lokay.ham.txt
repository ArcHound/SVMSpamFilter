Subject eog pronghorn location
michelle  i thought i would pass this along to make you aware that now eog
isn  t going to supply the efm at their new location  given that they have
yet to contribute the funds requested for our efforts  i don  t think we
should spend the money to put measurement out there until they send us the
     maybe we should ammend the interconnect agreement to change the
estimate back to the     we originally requested 
thanks  bob

laura  s work order doesn  t have anything about efm  only the costs to inspect
the construction and their connection to our tap valve  laura will check on
the responsibility of the efm equipment tomorrow
