 dear tech support 

 last year i upgraded from boyfriend    to husband    and noticed a
 slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had
 operated flawlessly under boyfriend     in addition  husband   
 uninstalled many other valuable programs  such as romance     and
 installed
 undesirable programs such as nfl    and nba    

 conversation    no longer runs and housecleaning    simply crashes
 the system  i  ve tried running nagging    to fix these problems  but to
 no avail  what can i do 

 desperate

                                                                       

 dear desperate 

 first  keep in mind that boyfriend    is an entertainment package 
 while husband    is an operating system  install tears    and enter the
 command 

 husband    should then automatically run the applications guilty    and
 flowers     but remember  overuse can cause husband    to default to
 grumpy silence     happy hour     or beer     beer    is a very bad
 program that will create snoring loudly  wav files 

 do not install mother  in law    or reinstall another boyfriend
 program  these are not supported applications and will crash husband    

 in summary  husband    is a great program  but it does have a
 limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly  you might
 consider
 buying additional software to improve performance  i personally recommend
 hot food    and lingerie    

 good luck
