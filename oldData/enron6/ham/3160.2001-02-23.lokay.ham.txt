here  s the other epng news flash    apparently  epng is telling shippers to be on the lookout for an announcement next week of another open season to guage shippers interest in a major expansion of its system  i  m assuming at this point this project will include the all american pipeline asset 
i  m also now told that the kern river expansion may be much larger than what we were led to believe a couple of weeks ago  we heard earlier that they were looking at doing a  mmcf  d expansion that would include the  mmcf  d expansion already sold  new information suggests that the  mmcf  d expansion may be significantly understated  and volumes may approach    mmcf  d  the expansion would include not only compression  but would involve additional pipe  and would not be rolled into existing rates  but would be an incrementally priced project
