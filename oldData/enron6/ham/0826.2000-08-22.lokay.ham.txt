Subject needles  topock price differentials
i have had a casual chat with some of my accounts regarding their opinion of
the market dynamics affecting the needles to topock price differentials 
each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of topock gas
supplies  rather than the incremental intra  state transport costs required to
transport to the pg  e citygate  as the primary driving force for the needles
to topock price differential 
here is a recurring theme i heard from my customers  the el paso merchant
service  epms     bcf contract  s block ii capacity   mmcf  d of permian to
pg  e  topock capacity     transport rate  has a re  callable aspect  if
epms schedules gas under the transport of block ii capacity to any other
california delivery point other than pg  e  topock  then other parties may
recall the capacity for their own use to pg  e  topock  currently duke has
recalled  mmcf  d and pg  e energy trading has also recalled  mmcf  d for
their use to transport permian gas to pg  e  topock   fyi  epmc may re  recall
this capacity  but they have elected not to   these additional topock
supplies coming from duke and pg  e energy trading under block ii capacity may
be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to pg  e at topock  this gas
competes head to head with malin gas prices  for example  today  s malin
price is     while pg  e  topock price is      today  s cash price
differential between needles and topock is     far larger than the
previously assumed    differential resulting from the intrastate cost
required to bring topock gas to the citygate 
if anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding these
market dynamics  let  s discuss further at our next staff meeting  cs
