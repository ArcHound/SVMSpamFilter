Subject confidential   re  august  tw conference call minutes
following up on my  to do  from our conference call  the information below
may be useful as we attempt to justify capital  operational expenditures on
the tw system 
objective  try and quantify in revenue terms the lost value of decreased
west throughput to tw
first a few assumptions 
fuel prices used were  permian       mmbtu and san juan       mmbtu
baseload volume flowing west was assumed to be      mmbtu  d
fuel consumed   
revenue impact is based upon current contracts and assumes lost fuel and
commodity charges only  tw continues to collect the reservation charges 
result 
based on current gas fuel prices  for every  mmbtu  d delivery we lose on
the west end  this translates to approximately    day of lost revenue  if
we assume the pressure drop at station  is preventing us from delivering
   mmbtu  d into socal  then the lost revenue for tw would be     per
day or       per year  to give you an idea of the significance of the
fuel value  of the     daily revenue  approximately     of it is fuel
related 
one more thing 
we assume here that tw continues to collect the reservation charges 
however  on a long term basis  if the west condition continues  we run the
risk of losing the reservation as well  based on    mmbtu  d  this value
equals       per year 
let me know if you have questions  i can be reached at
