    please read the following carefully if you intend to stay online  and
    continue using e  mail  the last few months have revealed an alarming
    trendin the government of the united states attempting to quietly push
    throughlegislation that will affect our use of the internet 
   
    under proposed legislation  the us postal service will be attempting
to
    bille  mail users out of  alternative postage fees   bill  p will
  permit
    thefederal government to charge a   cent surcharge on every e  mail
    delivered  by billing internet service providers at source  the
consumer
    would then
    bebilled in turn by the isp 
   
    washington dc lawyer richard stepp is working without pay to prevent
    thislegislation from becoming law  the us postal service is claiming
 lost
    revenue  due to the proliferation of e  mail  is costing nearly
        
    in revenue per year  you may have noticed their recent ad campaign 
    there
    is nothing like a letter  
   
    since the average person received about  pieces of e  mail per day in
      the cost of the typical individual would be an additional 
 cents
  a
    day
    or over   per year  above and beyond their regular internet costs 
   
    note that this would be money paid directly to the us postal service
 for
    a service they do not even provide  the whole point of the internet is
    democracy and noninterference  you are already paying an exorbitant
    price for snail mail because of bureaucratic efficiency  it currently
   takes
    up
    to  days for a letter to be delivered from coast to coast  if the us
    postal service is allowed to tinker with e  mail  it will mark the end
 of
    the
    free  internet in the united states  our congressional representative 
   tony
    schnell  r  has even suggested a       per month surcharge on all
    internet service  above and beyond the governments proposed e  mail
    charges
   
    note that most of the major newspapers have ignored the story and the
    only exception being the washingtonian  which called the idea of
 e  mail
    surcharge  a useful concept who  s time has come  march  th  
    editorial 
   
    do not sit by and watch your freedom erode away  send this to e  mail
to
    everyone on your list  and tell all your friends and relatives write
    their congressional representative and say  no  to bill  p  it will
   only
    take a few moments of your time and could very well be instrumental in
    killing a bill we do not want
