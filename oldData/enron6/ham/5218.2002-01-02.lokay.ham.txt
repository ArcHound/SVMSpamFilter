from our earlier conversation  this is what probably happened to virginia  s intended injection of    at the panhandle pool pnr point for      on pnr contract  
virginia had already discussed this type of transaction  meter bounce at nng  gray with burlington  since amy mulligan and chris miller worked with greg and hillary to inject gas back into the park n ride point for    after their initial withdrawal on     amy informed the customer on how to nominate transaction type  to create a  bounce  on the tw side of the station  they miscalculated the fuel usage and had to do a second bounce on    to balance their contract at that date 
virginia again withdrew gas on their park n ride on    with the intention to inject the gas on     the problem appears to be that burlington did their nomination for the timely cycle  but virginia did not get their information into our system until    pm which tagged it as an evening cycle nom 
chris miller confirmed burlington down to zero for the timely cycle since virginia  s contract did not appear on this cycle  i do not know how chris knew about this particular gas day  s transaction 
the tw late shift person did not know  or forgot  about the meter bounce so the two transactions did not get confirmed on the evening cycle 
the scheduling system will not display any meter bounce information unless you specifically request the point and the meter bounce filter 
our usual procedure to review unconfirmed nominations is to select a blank  null point and the  shipper nom  filter  it appears that meter bounces will not appear under this scenario  our system will also not show meter bounces by selecting a blank  null point and the  meter bounce  filter  our system does not have an  all noms  filter  since meter bounces are relatively rare in our system  shippers are strongly encouraged to contact us when they submit a meter bounce nomination  otherwise  we do not look for them in the system 
i am working with terry kowalke to make meter bounces more visible to us  but no one here is aware of any conversations with either burlington or virginia power regarding the meter bounce for    or any later date 
please let me know if i can supply any further information 
thanks  bert
