Subject electric developments
i consulted with kevin before i took the oars in trying to answer your
question  as well as the questions raised in drew  s e  mail  here  s what we
found out   
steve  s question 
what economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in new
mexico  maybe    mw  and build a line to the grid in california versus us
expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in california 
what you  re really asking here is  what are the comparative economics of
energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline   in this
analysis  there are a few considerations      original capital cost to
construct facilities     the operating cost of the facilities  including
energy loss  and    environmental and other permitting considerations 
engineers tell us that  as a rule of thumb  high voltage transmission lines
and tower facilities cost approximately     to   mm  mile to construct
turnkey  this figure is comparable to the   mm  mile  rule of thumb  we use
for turnkey construction of mainline diameter       high  pressure steel
pipeline 
in terms of operating costs  for anything over  miles in length  there are
three    basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission    
transformation loss     radiation loss  efm  and    heat loss across the
conductors  a rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is    this
number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on
transwestern  s pipeline 
the most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission
lines is in the area of permitting  there just aren  t many new transmission
lines being approved  it was suggested by more than one source that an
electric transmission project on the order posited in your example  could
take anywhere from  to  years to secure authorization  the issues of
electromagnetic field  emf  radiation around high voltage power lines  along
with other wildlife endangerment concerns  are significant obstacles in
securing permits for right  of  way 
in short  the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be
comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and
electric transmission lines  the protracted permitting process for electric
transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate
returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure 
drew  s questions 
  what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts
his plant 
for purposes of this exercise  i  m assuming we  re talking gas  fired
generation  developers generally describe four considerations in deciding
where to site a new electric power plant 
  market area demand  distributive  and  or transmission access to market
  water rights for turbine cooling
  ease of permitting  environmental  encroachment  fed  state  local
regulations  affected agencies  jurisdiction 
  proximity to natural gas pipeline  supply infrastructure
  do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various
utilities  power pools vary all that much or are order  tariffs pretty much
the same all over 
ferc order  and  require public utilities to commit to standards of
conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and
between other utilities and  or power pools in the various operating regions 
ferc ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission
access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate
their transmission  reliability functions from their wholesale merchant
functions  the rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under
ferc order      affecting interstate natural gas pipelines  it  s
pretty obvious from the california example this past summer  that with
respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual
states  particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of
independent system operators  iso  s   there is substantial room for
improvement  and possible further ferc involvement  
 in the open access final rule  order no     the commission issues a
single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of
service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission
service  all public utilities that own  control  or operate interstate
transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro
forma tariff  they must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own
wholesale energy sales and purchases  order no   also provides for the
full recovery of stranded costs   that is  costs that were prudently incurred
to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use
open access to move to another supplier  
  how do ipp  s decide what fuel supply strategy works best  i  e   buy
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs  buy gas  storage  transport  etc 
separately  
in my experience  there is no  one size fits all  formula or strategy  for
example  in the past we  ve seen calpine take a very hands  on approach to
supplying its ipp projects  in the mid to late    s  during the build out
of several qf  s  cogens   calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground
and dedicated them to the project  in today  s market  calpine has scavenged
the gas and basis traders from statoil and set  up a natural gas desk for the
purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western
u  s  power projects  in other projects  developer  owners and their lenders
are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply  transportation
to the project  in short  projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply 
transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics
and secure reliable supply by taking bids or rfp  s for gas
supply  transportation  or whether to take a more hands  on approach ala

  what is the rto rule and why should we care 
last december  the ferc issued order no    a final rule on regional
transmission organizations  rto  s   order  builds on the foundation of
orders  and   issued in    according to ferc chairman jim hoecker 
order  makes  a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations
from the influence of electricity market participants   therefore  order
 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the
functional unbundling adopted in orders  and   continuing balkanization
of the electric transmission grid based on corporate  not state or regional
boundaries  as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of
privately  owned transmission companies 
ferc prescribes a voluntary approach to rto participation  the order
initiates a regional collaborative process to foster rto formation  the
order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned  public
utilities  that are subject to ferc jurisdiction  and requires these private
utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate
the needs of transmission owning state  municipal  cooperative and federally
owned systems  ferc believes that  regardless of format  rto  s will offer
the following benefits     alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused
by structural changes in the industry     improve efficiencies in
transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion
management     improve grid reliability     remove remaining opportunities
for discriminatory practices     improve market performance     increase
coordination among state regulatory agencies     cut transaction costs    
facilitate the success of state retail access programs  and    facilitate
lighter  handed regulation 
critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility  voluntary rto
formation and transmission rate reforms  i  e   incentives   order  defers
for case  specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved
in order to create an operational rto  moreover  order  does not compel
any transmission owner to join an rto  but provides only regulatory guidance
and incentives for willing participants  as well as a veiled threat of
further consequences for the hold  outs 
as to the final part of the question   why should we care     presumably  the
development of a fully  functioning rto network will promote both the
efficiency and market transparency goals of the original ferc orders  as
ferc reads it  the future of gas  fired generation for both merchant and
utility systems  depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission
system  therefore  the promise of the rto is to stimulate competition and
the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure  unfortunately 
sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the rto program may ultimately
cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals 
  has    mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market 
natural gas prices of    mmbtu can only  kill  gas  fired power plants in
those instances where    there are more economical alternatives to natural
gas fuel     demand for electric power is offset through demand side
management or    natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly
prohibited from use as a power plant fuel  in the western u  s  marketplace 
particularly in california  i see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel
for electric power generation  renewable resources currently meet less than
  of the total electric resource requirements     barrel oil prices give
fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas  even at a    mmbtu
price   moreover  california environmental and permitting regulations make
the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than
natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible  while demand
side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting
resource needs  historically  they have served only a minor role in
offsetting the growth in electric power  as to the final point  i  m unable
to comment on the risk of future legal  regulatory restrictions governing the
use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel

when we originally decided to use my staff meetings for  graduate education 
one of the hot topics was the electric industry  we all had a first lesson
on this topic in shelley  s electricity seminar last summer  now  john and
kevin have graciously agreed to join us tuesday at    to discuss recent
developments in electric markets and nn  s and tw  s efforts to attract power
generation load to the system  specific topics i hope to cover include the
following 
  what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer
puts his plant 
  do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various
utilities  power pools vary all that much or are order  tariffs pretty much
the same all over 
  how do ipps decide what fuel supply strategy works best  i  e   buy
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs  buy gas  storage  transport  etc 
separately  
  what is the rto rule and why should we care 
  has    mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market 
depending on how deeply we get into these topics  we may need to schedule a
follow  up session at a later date  i look forward to seeing you on tuesday
