 cig
 the terminated cig oba had language to cashout at the ngpl midcon price in
 the month after the oba was terminated        
 the    index price was      dth     dth        due cig
 through october    

 mojave
 the old mojave oba does not have cashout language related to the
      termination date  therefore the current month pricing would be
 used for cashout 
 the march bloomberg natural gas el paso  topock  az  mojave  index price
 is      dth     dth        due transwestern through november
    

 please let me know if you agree and i will prepare cashout documents
