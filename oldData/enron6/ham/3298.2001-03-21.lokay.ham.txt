Subject fw  tw posting question   urgent
ok  i believe we have a consensus 
if i understand correctly our posting period for this capacity expires on monday at  p  m 
you should accumulate service requests for the capacity until that time  tie bids will be decided by a lottery 
if shippers ask you can explain to them that since this is newly posted capacity  we  re posting it until  p  m  monday and will not award capacity until that time  and if requests for service exceed available capacity we  ll award it based on the procedures in section  of the fts   rate schedule

per our previous decisions  we have utilized the provisions of section  for purposes of allocating capacity  therefore i agree with maria  that we would need to conduct a lottery if there are tie bids  i also agree that the reference to fcfs in section  is meaningless and should be eliminated  i would guess that that was there from inception  and has just been a non event  mary  put on clean up log  mk

i agree  however  does the first paragraph of the tf rate schedule say we will use first come first served  i remember seeing something that struck me as odd but i don  t have the tariff in front of me  thanks  df

importance  high
conoco did not exercise its right of first refusal on    of capacity on tw so it has gone back out on our ebb yesterday 
mindful of our posting guidelines for newly available capacity  i  e   days before we sell for a year or more   days before we sell it for a term of  months  lyear   day if we are going to sell it for  months or less   assume the following scenario 
march   capacity is posted
march   shipper a calls one of our marketers and offers max rate for the capacity for  years
march   shipper b calls and offers max rate for the capacity for  years
march   posting period ends  assuming of course that the capacity got posted at  a  m  on march  
questions  who gets the capacity  what do we tell shippers a and b 
we could say  first come first served   but our tariff specifically states that we will not maintain a queue 
is the better answer that we accumulate service requests until the close of the posting period  then have a lottery 
please let me know your comments  we need a consensus asap   before we get that first offer  thanks
