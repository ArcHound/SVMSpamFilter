lindy  could you verify if poi   is still valid for any reason 
ramona  it appears that some of these points are available for displacement  in the new system  linda indicated that a separate group has been set up for any points you have identified as valid  i will assume then that these should not be added to the paired template  ie  if a delivery point allows displacement  then they will only be added to the related basin delivery template  nominating this point as a receipt would depend on the displacement grouping defined in the new system for pools and interruptibles   
thanks
