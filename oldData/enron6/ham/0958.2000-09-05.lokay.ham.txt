Subject gpg windows   outlook project announcement
gpg will begin gathering information in september for our migration to
windows  and outlook  exchange 
windows   or w  k  is microsoft  s newest operating system and has been
selected as enron  s standard desktop operating system  along with this
change  we are moving from lotus notes to outlook  exchange as our standard
messaging  email  application 
this project is a huge undertaking  and we need everyone   s assistance to
ensure success  the gpg  it team will partner with each group to ensure every
aspect is covered  each group  it and the user group  will assign a point
of contact  poc  to work with the it group  the poc  s responsibilities
include application information gathering  identifying security requirements 
documenting all issues and concerns  and communicating project status 
we are approaching the windows   exchange project in a phased approach 
phase i  starting now and running through november  consists of   information
gathering   about hardware  applications  issues  as well as application
testing in our windows  lab and user sign  off  the phase i findings will
determine the phase ii start date 
phase ii  will be the actual   implementation   of desktop hardware  windows
 and outlook software  and user training  we will also be migrating
 user  data on the network to a windows  file server and migrating
applications to a windows  application server 
some of the benefits of migrating to w  k
increased desktop reliability and response time  windows  is much more
stable and robust than windows     nt 
increased system performance because minimum hardware requirements for w  k
are  mhz and above with  meg memory 
increased desktop manageability and enhanced functionality 
single sign  on for all users  servers  no more problems with trying to keep
all your lan and email passwords the same 
some of the impacts to migrating to w  k
some of the old office  word  excel  powerpoint or access  documents will
need to be updated  if you have any old documents that you think will not
move forward to w  k  please communicate this to your it poc 
we are aware that some hardware and applications may have problems running in
windows   we will work together to find a suitable solution for
everyone
