fundamentals have taken center stage  as building demand pressure accompanies
us supply declines  storage inventories have been significantly reduced  and
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into
the summer months  demand  driven growth continues  as completions of
gas  fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above    megawatts
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand  the result is a
higher  price playing field for natural gas  with the average henry hub price
likely to reach     per mmbtu for    its highest level since the
development of spot markets
