kern river submits     billion project to double system capacity
with its  expansion certificate in hand  kern river gas transmission co  last wednesday filed
with the commission its next capacity ramp  up  which would more than double the capacity of its   mile
gas pipeline system from opal  wyo   to california  the  expansion would bring supplies to a region
of the country that  has experienced well  documented  severe energy shortages   kern river said 
the     billion project would add    mcf  day of capacity to the    mcf  day that will be
available once the  expansion  cpol    is complete  if   july     said the aug   application  to
accomplish this  the  expansion would add    miles of   inch  diameter looping in wyoming 
utah  nevada and california and    miles of   inch  diameter looping of a segment owned jointly with
mojave pipeline co 
the application also calls for a net increase of    horsepower in compression  the upgrade
includes the construction of three new mainline compressor units  the proposed coyote creek station in
uinta county  wyo   the salt lake station in salt lake county  utah  and the dry lake station in clark
county  nev  five existing compressor stations also would be upgraded  and the daggett compressor
station would be reconfigured to compress only mojave volumes 
kern river also plans to build a new meter station under its existing certificate to interconnect kern
river  mojave facilities with the   inch  diameter adelanto lateral proposed by southern california gas
co  in response to a request from socal gas  the new kramer junction meter station is designed to deliver
up to    mcf  day by the planned dec   in  service date  although socal gas is committed to
provide only    mcf  day of firm access rights from this interconnect  additional takeaway capacity
will be available on an interruptible basis  the application said 
kern river reported that  long  term transportation service agreements have been entered into
with shippers  following an open season  about   of the capacity is contracted for   year periods and
the remainder for   year periods  the application said  based upon representations made by the expansion
shippers  nearly all of the capacity is projected to be used to serve existing and new power generation
markets in california 
by far the biggest customer for the capacity would be reliant energy services inc   which signed a  
year agreement for    dt  day  the next two largest subscribers are edison mission energy    
dt  day  and mirant americas energy marketing l  p      dt  day  
the expansion  s proposed initial daily incremental rate on a    load  factor basis  excluding fuel  is
   dt for   year firm service and      dt for   year firm service  in addition  the  expansion
shippers would be responsible for paying a fuel in  kind reimbursement factor of     for volumes
transported from wyoming to california  the rates would be lower for shorter trips 
as for supply  given the large volume of remaining reserves and the amount of drilling activity in the
rocky mountain region  production could increase by more than    bcf  day over the next year and by
   bcf  day over the next five years  according to a report prepared for kern river by barlow and haun inc 
in addition to the gas available from processing plants directly connected to kern river in southwest  ern
wyoming  shippers have access to supplies from other regions via northwest pipeline corp   colorado
interstate gas co  and questar pipeline co  at the opal  muddy creek market center  the application said 
two additional interstate pipelines  wyoming interstate co  ltd  and overthrust pipeline co   an  nounced
related open seasons in june that could result in interconnects providing access to supplies from
the wind river and wamsutter basins  the pipeline noted 
to meet the project  s may     in  service date  kern river asked the commission to issue a prelimi  nary
determination on nonenvironmental matters by feb      and a full certificate by may
