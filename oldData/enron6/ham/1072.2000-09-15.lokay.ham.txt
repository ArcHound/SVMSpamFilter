lindy  we receive a report from igs which does track the california
deliveries of kern river  the remaining volumes  and we do assume that kern
river is   full  does get dropped off to the nevada market  sometimes 
the california deliveries are as low as  mmcf  d  which does indicate a
strong las vegas  nevada market demand

kern river  s throughput to ca was only    did they have an outage  is the
remaining gas dropping  off before ca  we usually assume in our gas flows
analysis that kern is   full  this seems unusual
