Subject vector announces a one  month delay until december 
note  the market reaction is interesting  one can surmise that quite a bit
of the gas that was contracted for on vector is
firm utility gas  the run up in chicago may be temporary until alternate
arrangements are completed 
vector delay confirms market  s suspicions
future shippers on the new chicago  to  dawn vector pipeline had their fears
confirmed tuesday when pipeline officials announced that the start  up date
for the project  which was scheduled for nov   to coincide with the start  up
of the long  awaited alliance pipeline  would be delayed until dec   
vector officials blamed the delay on the excessive rainfall that has hampered
construction of the pipeline  which    when completed    would provide
initial takeaway for about  mmcf  d of the    bcf  d of western canadian
gas that will be shipped to the chicago market by alliance  alliance is due
to begin operations on oct   
the announcement yesterday left many in the market asking the million  dollar
question   where will that  alliance  gas go   in the meantime  alliance
officials noted the line has connections with existing pipelines and ldcs
serving the chicago hub that could pick up the slack between oct   and dec 
 
alliance  s jack crawford downplayed the impact of the vector start  up delay
on alliance   we don  t think  there will be  much effect at all  we have been
working closely with vector  our connection with them  if it  s not ready  is
very close  we also have five other connections with other  existing 
pipelines and ldcs  in chicago  many shippers  understand  that with  a
startup the magnitude of ours  alliance  and vector  s  there are likely to be
some bumps at beginning  
immediate market reaction to the news was somewhat unexpected  the chicago
basis for november widened from a plus      to plus    tuesday following
vector  s announcement  that is contradictory to what you would think would
occur  said a chicago trader for a large marketing company   i was offering
index  plus gas today betting on the chance that will come off by the time
bidweek rolls around   he said  the effect on the market wasn  t as profound
as some would have thought  agreed another trader   in fact  chicago prices
actually strengthened on the news  you would think that with the excess gas
on the market starting nov   the basis would have come off  the only thing i
can think is that people are betting on cold weather showing up in the
chicago market on nov   as well  
meanwhile dawn prices  which one would have expected to strengthen following
the news  did so  as november basis widened from low  s to plus  yesterday
following the announcement  a michigan trader said 
the vector pipeline would transport much of the alliance gas from the market
hub in chicago to the hub at dawn  on  as well as provide access to markets
and storage in the upper midwest  the line eventually will carry  bcf  d  but
its initial start  up delivery capacity will be  mmcf  d  the pipeline is
slated to serve key markets in ontario  quebec  and the u  s  midwest and
northeast 
 vector shippers were notified of the delay along with the rest of the market
tuesday  although many already had suspected the pipeline wouldn  t be able to
adhere to its scheduled start  up date  at an ldc forum in chicago a few weeks
ago  a spokesman for vector insisted the pipeline was on schedule  but then
sources said he showed pictures of parts of the pipeline underwater   folks
who were there knew what that meant  
presently  more than   of the vector line has been installed and progress
on the springville compressor station is on schedule  according to the
company  the dec   start  up date includes adequate time for any further
weather impacts and for the extensive commissioning and testing programs
necessary  it said  adding vector is scheduled to begin filling the system in
late october to complete the commissioning of facilities 
sponsors of vector include calgary  based enbridge inc  with a   interest 
westcoast energy inc  of vancouver  bc  with a   interest  and
detroit  based mcn energy group inc  with a   interest
