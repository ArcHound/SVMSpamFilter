Subject enervest  k   and ena  k   december invoices
i took a look at the two invoices and there should be no changes  because no gas flowed under these contracts for december  all that we could bill is the max reservation rate plus applicable surcharges  rather than the contracted daily rate of     and      
if you have any questions  please let me know 
thanks
