as the heating season approaches  a high   but justified   level of anxiety
regarding winter supplies is driving the gas market  as things stand  the
market
is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the winter
even
under normal weather conditions  this prospect has placed a floor on the gas
price at the price of residual fuel oil  itself priced in the mid  to upper
    s
range  gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back
into the market  diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply
concerns
again  to the upside  there is little demand response to price until
industrial
demand lessens or the price of distillate oil  as of this writing near    
per
million british thermal units  mmbtu   is breached  however  distillate
markets
themselves are extremely tight  and prices for that fuel would likely follow
gas
prices up  within this range  prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety   the
market   s judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall  which would be
characterized by extreme pricing and volatility  and a difficult process of
supply
allocation by price 
by now  exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain  although
cera expects storage injections to increase by approximately    billion cubic
feet  bcf  per day from august to september  this increase would still leave
inventories at record lows for this month and next  even this increase in
injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore
platforms  or if hot weather returns 
for october  heating load enters the picture  with us supplies running close
to
year  earlier levels and imports slightly higher  demand priced out of the
market
will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from last
year   s
low level  as a result  although prices may close the month of september in
the
upper     s per mmbtu  at the high end of the competitive range with resid 
any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward
during
the remainder of september or in october  as the heating season begins 
therefore  cera expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter to
result in the first ever monthly average price of     at the henry hub  see
table   and the first of potentially many months at or above that price 
gas storage   new record lows
cera estimates that storage inventories in the united states crossed into
record
low territory as of the end of august  when inventories of    bcf fell
below
the previous  record low of    bcf  see table    more records will
likely be broken in the coming months  and by widening margins  injections for
september are expected to average    bcf per day  an increase of    bcf per
day from the august level but below last year   s pace of    bcf per day 
cera   s september estimate could be exceeded under mild weather conditions
with no tropical activity hitting the gulf of mexico  but injections would
likely
fall below the    bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation of
platforms  this rate would leave us inventories at    bcf at month   s end  a
record low by  bcf 
for october  cera expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last
year 
injections of    bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by demand
priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropical
storm activity  october injections have varied historically from    bcf per
day
   to    bcf per day     even if injections reached toward the upper
end of this range  the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the
winter  at the expected injection rate  us inventories of    bcf at the
end of
october would result in an end of march  inventory level of  bcf under
normal winter weather   bcf below the previous record low of  bcf 
regional markets   waiting for winter
the pipeline explosion on el paso during late august intensified the
subregional
pressures already at play in western gas markets  cuts in pipeline flows
limited
access into california on the only pipeline route into the state with any
excess
capacity  the lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and
forced strong storage withdrawals in the california market  although summer
power loads in california will ease and much of the el paso capacity has been
restored  the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter
heating
load will keep intense pressure on topock prices  differentials in the rest
of the
west will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply to
ease pipeline bottlenecks  see table   
differentials in the east  which have traded in a narrow range this summer 
will
likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in
october 
however  exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this
year 
cera   s outlook by region follows 
 rockies  pipeline bottlenecks out of the rocky mountains
this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb
during october  cera expects that as local demand limits
pressure on pipeline capacity  differentials will narrow 
october differentials should average     per mmbtu 
 san juan  the resumption of flows on el paso   s southern
system  combined with production outages  has relieved
some of the access constraints on san juan supply 
seasonal declines in rockies to southwest flows and the
beginning of the heating season should narrow october
differentials to     per mmbtu 
 permian and mid  continent  the continuing pull on
supplies from the west will support permian prices  and the
midwestern pull on supplies will support mid  continent
prices  cera expects a differential to the henry hub of
    per mmbtu for mid  continent supplies and    
per mmbtu for permian supplies 
 chicago  the delay in the in  service date for alliance from
october  to october  will take some gas out of the
chicago market next month  this delay  combined with the
need to build midwest storage inventories  should sustain
the recent increase in differentials from the          
range to above     per mmbtu  cera expects october
differentials at the chicago citygate to average     
 northeast markets  gas prices near     have increased
the fuel cost of delivery from the gulf coast into the
northeast  raising the floor level for differentials to near
    per mmbtu  the beginning of the heating season and
the lack of new capacity into the new york citygate should
support differentials above the floor during october  at near
    per mmbtu 
canadian markets   outages affect supply
outages have affected supply thus far in september  both british columbia and
alberta have been affected  resulting in a further year  over  year decline in
western canadian supply  the various problems appear to be rectified  but the
average supply for the month is likely to be down  to  million cubic
feet
 mmcf  per day from september  
drilling has been adversely affected over the past several weeks by wet
weather 
but rig utilization is beginning to climb again to previous levels  more than
   gas wells are expected for this year 
slight drop in export demand
eastern canadian demand is still down approximately  mmcf per day  with
cooler  than  normal weather reducing the need for air conditioning  in the west
however  cooler  than  normal weather has accounted for an increase in demand
for heating requirements of about  mmcf per day 
exports are down slightly in september compared with september   with
pg  e gt  nw off  mmcf per day  northern border is running even with
september  
storage picture brighter in canada
storage injections in eastern canada have picked up  with inventories now
expected to reach the five  year average of  bcf  in the west  inventories
at
the end of the injection season will not only be above the five  year level but
should be even with those of   at  bcf 
wider differentials holding
after widening substantially in august to us      the aeco  to  henry
differential has closed back to a more typical level of     in september 
september   s aeco price should average us     per mmbtu  c     per
gigajoule  gj    increasing in october to us     per mmbtu  c     per gj
