cc  randy rice  ots  enron  morgan gottsponer  et  s  enron  darrell schoolcraft  et  s  enron  gary spraggins  et in this case  i used a       split of hexane plus  using this split of c   in a process model allows a closer approximation of how the gas characteristics will behave at various conditions  for the purpose of this analysis  the following is considered   agave red bluff on  line gc data is used as pipeline quality of gas in panhandle lateral because gs report from owens corning delivery point is quite similar to agave gc    gas temperatures will become nearly the same as ground temperatures which is provided on scada at p   and p    pressure and temperature profiles on the panhandle lateral at        am flowing conditions are listed below
the following graph  attached in ms word  is a phase envelope using the agave red bluff gas analysis  by mapping the above relative pressure  temperature points it is clearly observed that pipeline pressure and temperature conditions approach and cross the hydrocarbon dewpoint line indicating that liquids would exist 
the graph clearly shows that as the pressure and temperatures move further into the envelope the more liquids will be produced  that explains why more liquids are produced by pigging sections between cs p   and cs p    furthermore  using the process model used to generate the phase envelope  the model indicates that gas at  psig and  degf would exist in both vapor and liquid phases  using a flow rate of  mmcfd the liquid phase fraction would be approximately  bbls  per day that could amount to approximately  bbls  per month  this liquid volume compares closely to some of the recovery volumes reported by randy and walt below 
lets get together on a conference call to further discuss findings and possible solutions  for a first stab  how about tuesday      at    am  cst   reply with availability and number of ports required  ef

subject  re  pigging from p   to p  
thanks randy  along with the things you have stated we have a delivery point to gas company of new mexico near portales  nm  we do have a small scrubber there that we usually have to have hauled once a week and sometimes a couple of times  the  owens  corning  delivery can and will get us in trouble sooner or later if we don  t get a handle on liquids  i have ask eric faucheaux to take a look at the system and give us some ideas on where most of the liquid is falling out 
i have talked with  agave  the producer about this and we  re working together to try and figure out what  s going on  we can pick up water on our instruments but there  s not anything that we know of that will show condensate  this has to be carrying through in the gas because there  s not a large amount of liquids at the delivery point  the best solution at this time is to get enough gas to pig the line more often  after getting the liquid in at p   we ran a pig from roswell to p   and it came in dry  as soon as the volumes come up we  ll run from p   to p   then into p    thanks for everyone  s help in this  if we need a conference call to discuss let me know 
it had been about six weeks between pig runs this time  total received on the system was about three thousand barrels this time  the time before this run we received about six thousand barrels 
thanks

subject  pigging from p   to p  
gary  we recently had to run a pig from p   to p   in order to push about  barrels of condensate out of the line  we had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line  apparently  in order to run a pig  some volume has to be routed to that line  i understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this  but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it 
the condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with energas  this point feeds some domestic customers  we don  t want condensate getting into this point 
there is a customer on this line  owens  corning  who gets fuel from us  their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes  at any given time  i am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production  if they lose fuel  the product is lost and we could be liable  i am also told that once the plant goes down  it could take a long time  even weeks  to get it back up 
the owens  corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel  when the line has large amounts of condensate  we have been asking energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point  this is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure  the gas from energas is not measured  they used to have the contract  but when we got it  they removed their meter setting  apparently they agreed  verbally  to supply gas to the plant in march  for a few hours  when a pig was run  the plant uses about  mmcf  d and energas was on for about  hours  i was notified today that energas sent us a bill for the march pig run when we used their gas for fuel           obviously we will negotiate that amount  but they have us at a disadvantage  i can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about  hours 
everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule  we would not get large condensate amounts into p    which shuts us down  by the way   we would not have to use energas  we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point  and we would not incur the overtime when this happens 
i  m sure rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region 
we would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then  depending on what we push into p    get on a regular schedule    possibly once a month 
what do you think we can do to work something out 
thanks for any help you can give us

subject  re  pigging from p   to p  
just for your information the liquids that we received at p  is was very hot and high in btu  clear and evaporated quickly 
we would like to run a pig once a week until we clear all the liquids in this line  then back off as liquids decrease 
your help in this matter will solve many customer issues and concerns and our pipeline efficiency  we had a  pound spread in pressure last week due to about  bbls of liquid in this line  we received about  bbls on the run before 
thanks and know you are appreciated
