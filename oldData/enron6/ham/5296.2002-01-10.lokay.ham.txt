Subject fw  transwestern capacity release  ena  burlington
fyi  when january  invoices are run  please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ena  s contract   the deal was structured whereby tw would receive a marketing fee equal to   of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ena and tw  the other   goes to ena 
here  s the basics 
ena  s contract with tw is at a daily rate of      one  part 
the release to burlington is at a daily rate of      demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage 
tw will bill burlington through normal course of business  reservation of          x    x  days  plus applicable commodity fees 
ena demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of                   x    x  days 
tw will need to book marketing fee revenues of            x    x  days   richard  do we need  have a separate account for these revenues   
michelle  i know you indicated that ena is looking to get a payment of       for their portion of the incremental fee charged  however  we will need to discuss further  the invoice that will be generated to ena will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first  days prior to this release 
we can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches  if you have any questions  please let me know
