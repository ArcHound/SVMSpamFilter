subject  re  capacity south of ignacio
there was a burlington contract that i had in the tracker for  mmbtu  d from ignacio to the i  b link  i have taken this  mmcf  d out of my files  the line capacity south of la plata a has been in the  mmcf  d  recent discussions have lead to a new lateral capacity revision to  mmcf  d  but the ebb posting was still using   i have made the correction to the spreadsheets and the ebb to reflect the new increase in capacity

subject  capacity south of ignacio
i would like to confirm the availability of     d of transmission capacity south of the la plata  a  compressor  it has been my understanding that the capacity of the facilities is     d through the la plata  a  compressor south to blanco and that the capacity of the facilities south of the la plata  a  compressor is an additional     d south to blanco  for a total of     d 
northwest pipeline holds     d of southflow capacity through the la plata  a  compressor  that is all of their southflow capacity  so  tw has     d of capacity from la plata  a  and the whole     d of southflow capacity south of la plata  a  to sell 
i show that we have     d subscribed through the la plata  a  compressor south  i show that we have     d subscribed south of la plata  a   leaving     d unsubscribed south of la plata  a   i understand that the capacity at the red cedar  arkansas loop receipt point is fully subscribed at     d      d southern utes     red cedar      d texaco      d bp energy      d nwpl   but the capacity that  s reserved for nwpl at this interconnect is related to nwpl  s northflow transmission capacity  so it should not be included in the southflow totals 
therefore  i would like to confirm that there is     d of southflow capacity south of la plata  a  that could be sold from a receipt point other than arkansas loop  basically  the transport would have to come from the wfs  la maquina receipt point and deliver to either i  b link or ep  blanco 
please let me know if you agree  ron  if you could assist  it would be greatly appreciated
