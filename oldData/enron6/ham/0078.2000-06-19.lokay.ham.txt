 feedback 
 i don  t know if that is the correct product code  the product i am
 writing about is a soft  backpack style diaper bag from the  sarah 
 collection in a blackwatch plaid pattern  we own many graco product and
 have had trouble only with this one so far  this is a fairly new product
 but the vinyl that the velcro patch on the top flap is attached to has
 torn away from the flap  i am hoping that graco supports this product and
 will be able to correct the problem  please let me know what i need to
 do to pursue a remedy for this  i look forward to your reply  thank
 you  jim lokay
