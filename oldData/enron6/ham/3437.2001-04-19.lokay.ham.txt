importance  high
the march rate needs to be updated for the path wot  poi   to eot  the rate system still reflects     for this path rather than the calculated rate of      once this is done  please notify one of the schedulers to reverse and rebook for both february and march  if anyone has questions  please let me know 
thanks

to  elizabeth brown  et however  this rate was not changed for the other primary path wot to eot and was billed at the base rate of      this is an additional     that will need to billed to usgt 
these amounts should fall in line with what usgt was expecting  other than for differences due to rounding of the rates to four decimal places   someone in your group will need to update these rates in cbs and notify the scheduler to reverse and rebook for both months 
please let me know if you need anything further 
thanks
