fyi
i received a voice mail from jack foley at pg  e wanting to breakup the prepayment         due december  into four weekly installments  my response is to reject that request and walk him through tw with the most current information  this would be similar to what kevin did with two vendors this morning  nuovo pignone and labarge steel
