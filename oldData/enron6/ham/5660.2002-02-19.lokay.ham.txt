Subject red rock delays
the last  capacity available  analysis that i provided the group assumed that red rock would bring on    mmbtu  d of new west of thoreau capacity beginning june lst  currently  construction delays are expected to result in    mmbtu  d being delayed until june  th and    mmbtu  d being delayed until july  th  attached is my current estimate of west of thoreau capacity available for june  august  note that if we wanted to begin transport for our contracted shippers on june lst  we would be short of needed capacity by    mmbtu  d junel   and    mmbtu  d julyl    we need to discuss how this impacts our marketing strategy for june  august capacity 
thanks
