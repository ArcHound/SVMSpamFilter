Subject bp wtx to oasis
lorraine 
i ran a test case for the bp    dth from wtx pool to oasis for the term      to       below are the findings 
  point capacities for oasis  valero and delhi ward are okay for the term 
  the   lateral supplying these  points is slighly over the path capacity of    mcfd vs the ft of    dth  for the remainder of   lateral capacity opens a little the first of  
  btu content of the gas is 
  need    mcf of  btu gas to get    dth through the lateral to the delivery points 
  risk   if there is a call for all the gas at these delivery points  usgt     dth  astra      bp      misc       then we are at the maximium flow  any facilities problems or summer temperature extremes and we might not operationally make the delivery volumes 
my recommendation would be to only allow    dth from bp  historically usgt has not utilized their full    dth  do we want to take the risk and allow bp the full    dth 
darrell  i need some help with this one  give me a call
