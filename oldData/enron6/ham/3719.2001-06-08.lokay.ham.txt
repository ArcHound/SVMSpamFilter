Subject re  conocoprojreqform  xls  monument system
the existing capacity of this system is  mmcf  d 
now that we know where the exactl location of the tie  in is and based on your input i have created two flow modeling options for this project  
option   
assuming  mmcf  d from lanam ranch  the monument station can do another  mmcf  d from conoco at  psig pressure for a total of  mmcf  d  if the pressure at lanam ranch reduces  it will change the capacity to a lower figure 
option   
assuming   zero  from lanam ranch  the monument station can handle  mmcf  d from conoco at  psig pressure 
if the pressure at conoco reduces  it will create higher differential pressure at monument and that will reduce the capacity 
if you have any comments please e  mail me as soon as you can so we can finalize the capacity of this system

  what is the legal description of this tie  in 
  what is the maximum pressure that conoco can provide at this point
  if the volume from conoco is going to be  mmcf  d  how much gas are you planning to flow from the existing lanam ranch interconnect   to  mmcfd range 
  what is the pressure commitment at lanam ranch
these are required in order to develop a scope  costs for the project
