north america natural gas prices have increased nearly threefold in a year 
gas
has lost market share to the heavy end of the barrel  residual fuel  but it
also to middle distillates 
 cera estimates that the curtailment of gas supplies to interruptable
customers  combined with economically driven switching  accounts for as much
as    mbd of the strong year  on  year increase in us oil demand in january 
 for the short term  high gas prices are having a less pronounced effect on
the oil supply side in the united states  about    mbd 
 this spring about    mbd of the gains in oil demand due to switching should
be yielded back to gas
