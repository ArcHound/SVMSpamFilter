i just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the global settlement  one of your slides stated that the
tcr surcharge is applicable for  years from the global settlement  even if the cfs  s contract expires 
conoco contract nos     expired at the end of february  i assume we should bill the tcr
surcharge for these contracts beginning in march    please let me know if this is correct 
thanks
