cold weather in the midwest and reduced storage
injections have taken up much of the temporary slack
that developed in the gas market during the warm
october  as expected  prices have responded quickly to
the cold  with the december futures contract price
advancing by over     per million british thermal
units  mmbtu  in the past week  as cold weather
develops  late winter supply availability is still
uncertain in cera  s view  for that reason  dual  fuel
markets must remain off of gas  and market fundamentals
support the recent price rebound  which places gas
prices again at a premium to resid 
cera estimates that us working storage inventories as of
the end of october were approximately    billion
cubic feet  bcf   an all  time low for that date by 
bcf  see table below   storage injections of  bcf for
the week ending november  were higher than a normal
weather pattern would indicate  but more normal weather
for the remainder of the month would result in
withdrawals averaging    bcf per day during november 
this withdrawal rate is moderate by historical standards
but    bcf per day higher than occurred in the past two
years  see table below   this pace of withdrawals places
inventories on a path toward an end  of  march minimum of
 bcf under normal winter weather conditions  only 
bcf above the previous all  time low 
this market remains tight  although added supplies will
begin to help by the end of the winter  for now some
demand must still be priced out of the market in order
to preserve storage inventories
