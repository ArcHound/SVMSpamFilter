natural gas prices will be sustained above    
this spring and summer will present a major challenge to natural gas markets   refilling storage inventories while meeting underlying growth from power
demand  achieving these goals will require some demand to be held off of the
market  which will in turn require gas prices to remain above those of
distillate fuel oil 
 cera expects april to have the strongest injections since  
 gas prices will remain close to those of distillate through the end of
may 
 prices will be volatile  as the market is still in a precarious
situation
