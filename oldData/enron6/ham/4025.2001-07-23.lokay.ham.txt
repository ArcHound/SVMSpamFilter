subject  socal needles  window  allocation
i would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
procedure transwestern is using today for the socal needles  window  allocation 
some of the questions being asked 
  why are we allocating for socal   at their request  
  why are we allowing socal to set the capacity lower than tw  s primary firm 
  what are the options for tw to change the alloction procedure at needles 
i am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well  we are looking
at tuesday  july   at    a  m or wednesday  july      p  m 
please let ava garcia        know which day is better for you  then we will
get a room and let everyone know date and time 
thanks  lynn
