total imports of    bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by  million
cubic feet  mmcf  per day  see table    pipeline capacity into the state
during the month ran at  percent utilization  so far in august  pipeline
capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate  running at  percent 
these high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices
in southern california  and the pressure should continue during september 
total demand in california is expected to decline somewhat during september 
but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation
will provide support  total demand in the state should average    bcf per
day  down only slightly from august  s total of    bcf per day  flows into
the state between august and september are not likely to change
significantly  but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand  the
topock differential to the henry hub should average approximately     per
mmbtu for september  see table   
storage inventories in the west are still healthy relative to levels in the
rest of the united states  but the storage surplus in the region has eroded 
in california  inventories are running lower than last year  and the deficit
in the state looks likely to widen during september  the end of injection
season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of topock
differentials to winter price spikes 
pacific northwest
malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that topock
prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the rocky mountains
and san juan basins have shown  so far this month  prices at malin are
averaging a     per mmbtu discount to the henry hub  pipeline capacity into
the region from the rocky mountains is running nearly full  flows on pgt out
of alberta have averaged nearly    bcf per day this month  export capacity
out of the region on pge gt nw is running close to capacity  and pipeline
constraints to the south combined with strong california demand are driving
the wide malin  to  topock differentials 
continuing strong demand in the south will likely keep topock prices strong 
and the wide north  south differentials within the west will likely hold
through september  in the pacific northwest demand is expected to climb
through september to    bcf per day from    bcf per day in august  this
demand level should keep malin differentials from widening from current
levels  for september cera expects malin prices to average     per mmbtu
below the henry hub price 
southwest
prices in the san juan basin this summer have been left behind by rising
california demand  although the westward pull on supplies is strong 
bottlenecks between california and the san juan have led to disconnects
between san juan prices and topock prices  pipeline capacity utilization
rates on transwestern and the northern leg of el paso reached  percent
during july  with less than  mmcf per day of excess pipeline capacity 
increased flows from the rockies on transcolorado and northwest are
contributing to downward pressure on san juan basin supply  and in general 
the san juan has followed rocky mountain prices rather than following prices
at topock or the permian basin 
unlike in the past two summers  the bottleneck has not allowed power demand
on the west coast to support san juan prices relative to permian prices  the
differential between san juan and permian has averaged     per mmbtu so far
this month and     per mmbtu since june  additional imports from the
rockies into the san juan have increased supply by  mmcf per day relative
to last summer  but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect 
without much change in southwestern or rocky mountains local demand  the san
juan should continue to price at a wide discount during september  the san
juan  to  henry hub differential is expected to average     per mmbtu  as in
the rockies  differentials should narrow substantially in october 
rocky mountains
downward pressures on rocky mountain prices intensified over the past month
as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb 
record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand
within the region  generation is still largely coal  based  and the demand
impact on gas of the additional load is minimal  cera expects the heavy
discount  current rocky mountain  to  henry hub differentials are around    
per mmbtu  to persist through september  local area demand is not expected to
change during september  substantial gain in local demand comes in october
with heating loads  october demand should average    bcf per day  up from
august and september averages of around    bcf per day 
although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the
rockies  winter differentials are expected to stay in the     to     per
mmbtu range  strong storage inventories will limit the connection with
broader north american markets this summer  next summer  pressures on rockies
supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer  although pipeline
expansion projects have been announced  trailblazer and williams announced
expansion plans this summer  the new capacity will not be online to relieve
constraints next summer  cera expects supplies within the rocky mountains to
increase by  mmcf per day next year 
western canada
after widening to over us     per mmbtu  the aeco  henry differential has
begun to narrow somewhat  maintenance that has restricted flows has largely
been responsible for the jump from     per mmbtu in july  with current
supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes
having to pay full cost to flow  differentials are likely to persist in the
mid  us     s per mmbtu for september  aeco is expected to be us     per
mmbtu  c     per gigajoule  for september  even with the start  up of the
alliance project  the contract nonrenewal on transcanada is likely to
continue the two  tiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted
pipeline costs  this will result in differentials that will range between
us     and us     per mmbtu throughout the winter 
supply build in western canada continues to languish behind last year  s
levels  the pace of drilling  over    gas wells are expected this year 
should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into   supply is expected
to be flat with  on an annual basis for this year and up at least 
mmcf per day in  
sumas prices have been quite volatile  driven by both weather in the pacific
northwest and maintenance on the westcoast system  for september  sumas is
expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to aeco
of us     per mmbtu
