with steve stock and jeremy wong

help to insulate us from the current intra  night process for the erms and

subject  problems with morning cashflow process
hi jonathan 
listed below are the details of each days problems 
fri  sep   
autorho failed at    am  uploaded only  books into infinity 
it failed on the step in autorho where it runs the query to get all the books
for the infinity usd portfolio  jeremy does not know exactly what caused it
but rerunning autorho seemed to work 
recovery used the backup file and was on time 
tue  sep   
similar problem to friday  but enpower also failed  the manenpower  txt file
had tns errors in it  autorho was not able to kick off the enpower script to
get the cashflows  rerunning fixed the problem 
autorho failed at    am  uploaded only  books into infinity 
it failed on the step in autorho where it runs the query to get all the books
for the infinity usd portfolio  jeremy does not know exactly what caused it
but rerunning autorho seemed to work 
recovery used the file that jeremy provided in the rerun  they were
approximately  minutes late 
wed  sep   
enpower failed creating a header only manenpower  txt file  there was no
cashflows in the file 
jeremy confirmed the autorho process was fine 
the problem was the enpower databse failed  hardrive failure  and they
immediately went to a backup  but on the backup database  not all the tables
are replicated  the cashlow table with the enpower data we needed was not in
the backup database resulting in a file with zero flows 
this problem has been fixed by the enpower people 
recovery included using the previous day  s enpower flows  they were on time 
thurs  sep   
autorho at    am and    pm was hung  enpower also was not run since
autorho failed 
reason was because the unix nfs file system  solar  was full as a result 
our directory  worksheets   and also  prod  egs  home is mounted on solar but
could not write anything to it  supposily the sa are suppose to have been
paged when ever a file system gets close to    can you please confirm
this    the unix nfs was fixed by    am  autorho was rerun and was fine 
recovery included jeremy  s file  they were  hour late  partly due to other
reasons on mo side  not system related  
thanks 
kevin lee
