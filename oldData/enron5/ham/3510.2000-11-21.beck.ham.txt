it appears only the uk gas mtm made it for the v  r run in houston today 
uk power   despite the spotlight being on this feed due to the first run of
the new evaluation system  was officialised late and required the below
mentioned adjustment 
contintental power  officialised late 
nordic power  was officialised around  am london time  the slowness of the
current feed to houston prevented the feed reaching there on time  feed has
been rewritten by it to speed up the process and is currently in uat 
however  it appears the normal time for officialisation this book is around
   am which allows the feed to hit to normally hit on time 
appreciate if you could looked into the above

we have a topside adjustment to put through of o        against south
western electricity plc  this is due to pd deal eo   peer id  being
valued in enpower when it was supposed to be excluded from the mtm
