subject  webmodal
at monday  s egm meeting  mike mcconnell asked me to describe the webmodal
acquisition egm made last week  following is a brief description of the
freight capacity market and what webmodal gets us 
market
the us market for logistics is   bn annually  we are pursuing the largest
homogenous segment which is long  haul truckload and intermodal  that market
is      bn annually  depending on who you ask and whether you include
dedicated fleets 
the interesting thing about these markets is that they are extremely
fragmented and massively intermediated  there are over    trucking
companies  carriers  in the us and thousands of independent brokers  brokers
in this market act as credit principals       of all loads are conducted
in the spot market  brokered  and the rest are done under    year contracts
that are generally non  firm  but define the relationship between each shipper
and their chosen carriers or intermediaries 
on the rail side  the us railroads act as wholesalers  selling their capacity
to intermodal marketing companies  imcs   the imcs then retail or broker out
that capacity to shippers  the difficult part of ground intermodal is that
the rail haul makes up only the long  haul component  the trip from the
origin warehouse to the origin rail yard and then the delivery from the
destination rail yard to the destination warehouse has to be done by truck 
this first and last mile transportation is called  drayage  
webmodal
webmodal developed a system to price and schedule intermodal moves so they
look identical to truck  they have a database with prices and schedules from
all the rrs and  drayage companies that gives them complete us coverage  a
buyer can type in their scheduling and equipment requirements and receive
instantaneous quotes for zipcode to zipcode service 
because of the inherently different cost and performance structures of rail
and truck  the pricing differences between the two modes of transportation is
significant  for any move greater than  miles  intermodal is generally
    less expensive than a single driver truck move  the substitutability
of intermodal and truckload should allow us to trade the spread in price 
the webmodal acquisition gets us a team with tremendous industry expertise
and a good head start as we enter this market  the next move will be to
build a truck intermediation capability 
i encourage you to meet chris kravas the ceo of webmodal  he will be
spending all of his time in houston when he is not on the road 
please give me a call if you have any questions 
thanks
