i don  t think i have seen you this year  happy new year 
i have been asked what company name should be put on the business cards of
some of sally beck  s group  i have been telling most people to stick with
they organisation names e  g  enron north america or enron south america 
rather than enron americas  enron wholesale services  do you want everybody
to use enron net works  or should the trading support groups use their
business unit names ena  egm  eim
