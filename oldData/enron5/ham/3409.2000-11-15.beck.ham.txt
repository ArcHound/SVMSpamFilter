dear kathy  darren 
i  ve spoken with marcelo parra here in new york regarding phone
recording for the enron metals offices  the rac group insists that recording
is done asap and i need to report back to marcelo the install dates of the
equipment in montreal and st  louis  if you have such info or know who is
responsible  please let me know 
i understand that we are several months away from the installation of a
new switch with central recording capability here at the  madison office
in new york  as an alternative  i can install a refurbished digital
recording system for  telephones on the concentrates and metals trading
desks for approximately      the recording device will be located in
our telephone room and is not accessible to the traders  all equipment is in
stock and we can have the desks recorded by december   i need a quick
approval since the vendor will only hold refurbished equipment until friday
afternoon for us  barry  can you give the ok 
also  recording for the chicago office should not be an issue since the
enron metals people are moving to the existing enron chicago facilities
before the end of the year
