subject  full time analysts opp 
          dear lexi 
                         my name is andrew haryono   i am a ut student
majoring in professional program in accounting   i will be graduating this
may  with a mpa degree    i will also be sitting for the cpa exam this
may   even though i have an audit background   my career interest is to do
financial and accounting analysis   the analyst  s job description at enron
matches perfectly with my career interest   i signed up for the internship
opportunity through the careerportal system  because i could not find any
full time opportunity  as for now  i have not received answer from enron   i
am writing to ask further about the  career opportunity with  enron 
        my questions are 
   is it possible to turn this analyst  internship opportunity into
full  time permanent opportunity  
    if that  s not possible would you have opening for me in the near future 
   i am reattaching my resume   thank you and i look forward  to hearing
from you 


sincerely
