Subject sec var for may
i know that you do not need numbers until late next month  but i thought you
might want an early look at may 
one number is particularly interesting  var for the total return swaps  you
will notice that it decreased substantially from about   million in march
to about   million in may  we had several deals that expired  churchill 
piti guam  and blackbird   reducing risk  and only one new one  motown  
most importantly  we cut back on our exposure to rhythms from    million
shares in april to    million in may  and the stock price continued to fall
from   to   to   per share  the less the investment is worth  the less
we can lose in it  
we will send you june numbers as we collect them
