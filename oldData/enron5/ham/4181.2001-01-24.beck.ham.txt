Subject we are for the most part finished with sec var  we are missing october and
december brent crude commodity positions  when we get these numbers we will
reissue this report  but they are not likely to be different enough from the
guesses we inserted to make a difference 
total var is the highest i have seen at   million 
one reason is that trading commodities var remains very high at   million
 though it is down from the   million of november  
the other reason is that trading securities var is by far the highest it has
been at   million  merchant assets  with a var of   million  and total
return swaps  with a var of    up from   in november  are at all time
highs 
bacchus and riva  both originated in december  conspired to increase total
return swap var  nevertheless  the biggest culprit is cerberus  a fixed for
eog shares swap we put on in november   cerberus contains ten million
unhedged shares of eog  the value of the shares increased from   in
november to   in december  raising var substantially
