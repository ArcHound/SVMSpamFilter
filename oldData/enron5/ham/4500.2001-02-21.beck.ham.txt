joel has been negotiating with open text along with ryan orsak  as enron has
been providing numerous resource hours testing their  beta  product that
integrates livelink with irims for records management processes  our
experience has been that we are finding way too many problems and that the
product does not function as  advertised   therefore  joel sought a credit
to reimburse enron for the value of the testing we have performed for them 
the     software credit will likely be used to purchase the web front end
to the livelink product 
congratulations  joel
