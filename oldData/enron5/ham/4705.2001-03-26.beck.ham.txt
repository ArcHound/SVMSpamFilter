here is the actual presentation requirements as per the rfp  we can deviate
from the form  but must address their stated requirements  i think we
should structure the enron portion as follows 
i  enw overview
ii  products and services
iii  engagement approach
let me know what you think  we need to pull this together today 
i  ve also attached the material steve sent me previously 
thanks
