Subject timing of submitting information to risk controls
over the past few weeks  we have not been receiving information from the risk
management groups on a timely basis  this memo serves to convey our
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group 
our reporting is as follows  houston time  
    posting of preliminary dpr to website  needed to be done prior to rac
 am meeting 
        preparation of the violation  notification memos
    finalization of the dpr  memos
in order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to
meet the following deadlines  houston time  
before leaving to go home  houston   officialization of books  to ensure
information is captured in var engine and credit agg 
    london   officialization and sending of feeds to it
    all   export of preliminary information
        support on explanations of violations  notification memos
    london only   export of final information  needed at that time for
merchant asset group 
    houston only   export of final information
everyday at least one group misses the deadline  which is unacceptable 
please ensure deadlines are met going forward  remember  the dpr cannot go
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the
whole process 
thank you
