per the conference call today i am confident that we can add value to the
commodity logic project  i base this on the success of enron online and
valtech  s role of supporting that effort  currently  we have the architect
 david jayakaran  that designed the presentation framework for eol available
as part of the team  i mention this because of the obvious synergy between
the eol framework and commodity logic  as discussed david will meet with you
on wednesday  the action items i owe you are the enron negotiated rate
structure and profiles for consultants that could start immediately  the
daily rates are senior consultants at     and consultants at      the
profiles are attached for your review  please contact me if you have any
questions
