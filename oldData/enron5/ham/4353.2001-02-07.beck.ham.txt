Subject clcikpaper cost per trade
as requested  i have come up with a rough estimate of the cost per trade for
clickpaper  from a product control group  call center prospective only  
the average cost per month for the team  fully loaded  salaries  benefits 
plus expenses  is      the average number of trades per month is  
therefore  the average cost   per trade 
as a comparison  the average cost per enrononline trade      as you can
see  it is much lower due to the volume of transactions  we will recognize
the same economies of scale when the clickpaper trades increase  we do not
anticipate needing any additional staff this year 
please let me know if you have any questions
