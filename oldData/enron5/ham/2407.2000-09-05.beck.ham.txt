subject  cash flows from ei  gns  gas  prc
infinity showed a   mm notional curve shift change in the ei  gns  gas  prc
commodity book for       this change caused a      pvol affect on the
trader  s sensitivity report  after talking with susan in ei  it was brought
to our attention that the bolivian curve was loaded incorrectly on friday 
due to a change in ei  s curve upload process  this change resulted in the
bolivian curve loading throughout   when it actually goes out to  
the incomplete curve caused infinity to get bad cash flows 
as a result  we had to re  do pdh reports this morning  final reports were
given to traders at    am
