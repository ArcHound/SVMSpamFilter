i would appreciate a copy of the drift number submitted for budget  and a
copy of the analysis for enron europe 
i would also like a copy of the expected new deals for  reflecting the
average increase  or decrease in the pv of the gross book balance  i need
this infomation in dollar terms not percentages  i need to have the new deals
separately for gbp  nok  and eur  we are reviewing drift and our
anticipated interest rate position vs  expected  economic climate
