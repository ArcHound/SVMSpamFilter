we have been having issues with the commodity cash flows since last friday 
aug   this is a listing of what  s been going on 
time pdh
date commodity book given to trader summary of discussion
     enpower  west    original west cash flows did not look
right  valerie left voice mail
late thursday night stating not to treat the   m gain as
final  she indicated that lavorato was going to review the
cash flows this morning and she will let us know the final
number at that time  these cashflows created a    
pvol affect 
   re  ran w  old west cf after consulting with pushkar  we
replaced the new west cash flows with prior days so hedging
could begin 
   final spoke with monica lande at    am and she stated that
the original cash flows received were real  we then had to
bring the original cash flows back and re  do the pdh
reports 
     refer to email sent by sheila on this day 
     uk  nap  lt  prc    cash flows received from the uk book looked
really weird 
the   m cash flow curve change created a    pvol
affect  we contacted guy freshwater regarding  he
indicated that per mark fondren  the book was officialized
monday  on friday since monday was a holiday for their
office  we backed out the new cash flow  and then substituted
the old ones 
     uk  nap  lt  prc    original the same thing happened as      
the book was not officialized
   final on     therefore we received the same incorrect cash
flows  we again
substituted these cash flows with those received on       i
talked with
mark fondren and he indicated that the book has now been
officialized 
 in the past we have not had issues with the uk commodity books in
the
erms system  
     enpower  west    original cash flows received for west created
a    pvol affect  we contacted
   final monica lande and she informed us that there was a   m
loss in their book 
but   m was not real  we asked for a cash flow strip for the
incorrect flows  but she was not able to provide it  therefore  we
used the previous day  s cash
flows  after the    pdh report  the system started running slow 
therefore
it took even longer to produce a revised report
