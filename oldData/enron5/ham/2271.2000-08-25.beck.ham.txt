subject  trend analysis for select commodity groups
attached is a trend analysis on the four primary commodity groups which have
either been demonstrating  or have been thought to be demonsrating  a decline
in eol transactions as a percentage of total trading activity  the graphs for
each group represent a line plot of eol  s weekly percentage of total trading
activity by deal count and volume over the last three months  the attachment
also contains source data on the second and third pages  which gives the
absolute numbers represented by the percentages shown on the graphs  these
sheets contain several additional commodity groups which have demonstrated a
decreasing or erratic eol trend  but were not graphed because they averaged
less than    total transactions  both eol and non  eol  per week 
a few notes on the four graphed commodity groups 
austrian power  the overall eol trend as a percentage of transactions in
austrian power has been upward over the last three months  despite the sharp 
temporary decrease which took place at the end of july as a result of the
head austrian power trader and stack manager going on holiday  since his
return  the percentage has picked back up and as of    about   of
austrian power trades were once again being done through eol  there is cause
for concern here  however  in the fact that the absence of one trader
effectively shut off eol trading in this commodity group 
lpg  the lpg products have followed a somewhat erratic path since inception 
with eol transactions typically accounting for between  and  percent of
total lpg trading activity  this overall trend remains intact and as of    
eol accounted for   of lpg trades 
crude  products  this commodity group has been demonstrating a steady
decline in eol trading activity over the last three months  while eol trades
accounted for approximately   of all crude and products activity in may 
this percentage has dropped off to just over   as of august  nd  this
trend is particularly disturbing because of its consistancy  as well as the
relatively large data pool on which it is based 
uk power  although the absolute number of trades in uk power dropped off
significantly at the end of july  eol  s percentage of uk power transactions
has remained fairly stable  eol  s percentage of uk power trades  spiked 
briefly during the second week of june  but outside of this the percentage of
uk power trading represented by eol transactions has fluctuated between 
and  percent  on trade date     eol transactions accounted for just over
  of all transactions done in uk power
