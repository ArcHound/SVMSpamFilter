hey ken 
i just wanted to let you know that the financial settlement group were very
impressed with unify during the first training class that we had on friday 
i did not hear any negative comments  and they even said they liked it better
than sift  some of the key areas in which they see great benefit are 
  the automatic calculation of in and out of the money options
  the statement group assignment screen and the idea of selecting different
statement groups for different payment terms
  the ability to sort and subtotal on financial list screen
  the system is more efficient than sift
  the ability to view the invoice on screeen and to click directly on the
line to make adjustments
  the ability to wire foreign currencies  really and sap enhancement 
one thing that i did hear is that they wished they could see enron north
america and ena global together on the financial list screen 
i think the development group did a great job  and i enjoyed working with
everyone  i hope that in the next few weeks and months ahead that you will
continue to allow the team to provide our group with quick and efficient
response to areas of concern and enhancements 
thank you to the group for all of your hard work 
becky
