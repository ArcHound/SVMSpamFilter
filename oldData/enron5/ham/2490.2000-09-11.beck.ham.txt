sheila
changes to the manual list for north america need to be authorized by wes and
sally  we are specifically limiting the number of signers 
i think that what we need to do is immediately address the issues that are
causing your wires to miss the standard process  we did not have the issue
prior to sap 
please outline your processing requirements and we can work together with ap
and sap to fix the underlying issue 
thanks for the help

mary  larry and wes 
we just received a faxed copy of the manual wire and same day payment memo
which was sent by betty tauzier on      
rate  currency trades fx which is settled the following day and requires
next day payments for fx  currently we are severely hampered because our
infomation is required into unify by    for an accounts payable run at   
for next day payments  we are still trading after these cut  offs and tying
out the day  s activity with trading  therefore  we currently have to rely on
manual wires to make payments to our counterparties on the value date 
we need to get timeframes which mirror our business requirements  i would
like to get the accounts payable run for our companies   and   moved to
after    pm  information is not due to the bank until next day     am
london time 
please let laurel and me know what changes can be done to our processing
flows 
thanks  sheila
