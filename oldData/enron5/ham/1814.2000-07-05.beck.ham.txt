subject  unify to sap interfaces
we interfaced unify to sap three times today  interface number one     am 
was error free  the second interface  noon  created duplicate invoices for
those sent in our first interface  the problem that caused the duplication
was that the flag in unify that prevents invoices from being sent to sap
after they have already been interfaced did not work  the problem was
corrected before out third interface at    pm  in the    interface  one
error occurred    a counterparty was set up in global as intercompany that
should be third party  this error will be corrected before our next interface
on    am 
overall  i was pleased at how well the interfaces worked today and how fast
the sap and unify teams responded to our issues
