Subject re  mpr for     
mr  hall 
i have just reviewed the merchant portfolio summary for    and have the
following questions 
  calme shows an asset of     mm and apachi shows an asset of     mm
and they show no p  l for the year
is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums
and commodity prices 
  india recently invested in an ipo  rediff  com  for which there was a
simultaneous dash to buy and sell  sounds like a merchant deal  
where does this show up 
  there are several bonds  publicly traded  registrered securities  housed
in our prime broker accounts  owned by various enron entities
that i do not believe are on the dpr  shouldn  t they be  and if so  who is
deciding not to include 
pls advise at your earliest convenience as you always do 
thanks
ted
