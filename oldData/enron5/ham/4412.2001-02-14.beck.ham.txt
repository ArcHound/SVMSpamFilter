hi  sistas 
here  s the scoop on the josephine house 
we can reserve with just a credit card  no deposit required 
parties under     room fee    valet parking fee 
i confirmed    with mom 
heidi sent some sample menus  a   course menu  appetizer or salad  entree 
dessert  is   
a   course  same as   course plus hors d  oeuvres  sample menu is   
each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course  the
food sounds really good 
so  here  s a guess at cost 
 people at     
beverages   
gratuity   
valet   
room rental   
total    or   per family if we divide it into
thirds
what do you guys think  should we explore other options  or just go with
this  i think chris and i would be fine with this sort of cost  but
probably couldn  t go crazy with gift and decorations too  so  if we really
want to do the photo  s   do we have a cost for these yet   we may want to
consider other options  thoughts   cara
