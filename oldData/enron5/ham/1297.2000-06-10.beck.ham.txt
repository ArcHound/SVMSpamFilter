mary 
one of our team members  anshuman srivastav  is currently in houston  it
would probably be useful for the  of you to meet  so that we can understand
exactly what your plans are with regards to lng and what exactly you will
require as far as contracts go 
failing that  the person  who is the official keeper of all our contracts 
is sandeep katwala  he should be able to get you whatever you need 
let me know if you have any difficulties and i can try and hunt stuff down
