at the meeting i was told  weeks to a month out  i think they would like to
start earlier and probably came over here with that intention  but they still
have some legal  tax and obviously back office things to sort out  so
basically as soon as commercially possible   
they flew back to houston today  so i expect to hear more details in a couple
of days  after they chase down some legal and tax issues   in the meantime 
we need to get with brenda and her group to sort out the back office details
as soon as possible  as you know  global products is currently only
supporting    financial trades per month  confirms and settlements through
ectric

thanks for the call  brenda herod is the operations controller for eim 
 brenda and brent in their roles over eim and egm  respectively  are both
direct reports of mine   brenda is out of the country through the end of
this week on vacation  touring europe with her mom  if there is a need to
address this issue this week  let me know and i can start down that road
until brenda returns  let me know 
i did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that clickpaper  com is set to
go live in london within  days  i am trying to find out if that is true 
if it is  it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in houston to do so
this past july without letting anyone in the mid and back office know  we
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry 
not ideal  i hope that history has not repeated itself  let me know if you
have heard anything on this
