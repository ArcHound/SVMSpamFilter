subject  unify to sap interface    day 
as on day  we ran the unify to sap interface at    am  noon  and    pm 
set out below are the results of these runs 
the interfaces for enron north america  financial for gas  weather  and pulp
and paper  were error free 
the interfaces for ena global products   financial resulted in two invoices
not being accepted by sap  this was due to a sap error that has occurred
about three times in test  however  the sap team cannot duplicate the error
in order to correct  they are still trying to find the root of this problem 
the two transactions which were not picked up by sap were resent successfully 
the interfaces for ena fx financial uncovered a breakdown in the process  the
payment program for this entity is to be processed manually by the accounts
payable dept  for july  and today  the ap dept  forgot to process the
payment program resulting in nine payments   us    canadian  and  gbp 
not being paid  we were able to get all payments out today through sap
except the gbp payment  the gbp non  payment was discovered by a counterparty
calling and stating that they did not received their funds  the us  and
canadian non  payments were discovered when we reviewed our bank statements
and found that the funds were not disbursed  for future interfaces  bernard
is to call treasury after each interface is processed to ensure that the
payments for this entity were received by them
