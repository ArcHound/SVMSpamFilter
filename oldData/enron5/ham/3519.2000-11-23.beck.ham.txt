i thought you might be interested in some information brought to me today by
andy cornfield  director with the london risk management operations team  
with regard to fx positions at enron metals  
the overall fx exposure of the metals business is not yet routinely laid off
with the fx  interest rates desk 
euro currency exposure associated with a euro aluminium option is managed by
tim jones  the head of the metals financial trading desk  this position is
managed under a limit of   m  which was mg  s old fx limit  enron metals is
treating this limit as an enron corporate fx limit for the purposes of
managing this position and all other fx exposure 
proprietary fx positions are occasionally being taken  most recently  andy
has found that yesterday a metals trader opened a long euro  million
position for value     the trader is not the principal fx trader on the
metals desk  although he was formerly an fx trader with billiton  acquired by
mg in   and he became mg  s assistant fx trader prior to enron  s
acquisition of mg 
with regard to the last item  risk management and rac discussed this with
mike hutchinson and it was agreed that the euro  m position will be closed
out tomorrow 
as far as the first two items are concerned  rac and risk management will be
working with commercial heads to help ensure that enron corporate policy is
clearly communicated and applied
