Subject power port calc issues
the power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the
power port calc  the same memory allocation issue which i discussed in the
message below is not resolved  we have had this problem for about four months
now   due to business reasons  we calculated the east power books on monday
 enron holiday   we received all of the required data to calc by    am and
should have been completely done by     however  the calc crashed six
times and finally completed on the seventh try  we were able to leave by
    the point i am trying to make is that i feel that we are at such a
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders
by the start of the next business day  this could have a financial impact on
our company  once again  i am urgently and desperately asking for resolution
of this problem 
furthermore  it came to my attention on friday that ees is now using enpower
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are 
i question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing
business that is using that server  per discussion with kevin presto  the
agreement made regarding ees  s use of enpower was there would be no expense
or degradation to ena  s business process  i think they need to move to
another server 
please call to discuss when this will be resolved  thank you

subject  athena vs quark
with regards to the message below  we must have athena  server  to run our
nightly risk books for the power group  we run one of our three east power
calcs on this machine  the second largest one   since an acceptable solution
for the big power calc has not been provided to us  athena cannot be taken
away from us  the east power calc crashed  out of  days last week  we
usually start calcing at about     the calc time is now running at   
hours and we have about    hours  worth of work after the calc  s successful
completion  so you do the math on what time my group leaves the building
when the calc crashes at    
furthermore  the west power calc has crashed  out of  nights weekly for the
last  weeks  this is not acceptable 
we are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our
system is not stable  i feel like we have been very patient at the expense
of many late nights  i am going to speak to kevin presto and tim belden
today about these problems 
i think we need to meet immediately about this problem and i am exhausted
with the finger pointing between different it groups 
thanks
