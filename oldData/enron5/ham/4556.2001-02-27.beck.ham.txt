all priority   cp  s will be completed within  days  march     
ees has approximately    counterparties to be entered into the gcp
database  we have been dealing with ees  karin williams and scott mills on
the gcp set up 
we have quoted ees a rate of     per counterparty entered into the gcp
database  we currently have  people working full time on the research 
calling and entering of ees  s cp  s  beginning in january   we anticipate
utilizing a mutually agreed upon monthly fee 
jason moore and i are the designated global contacts for ees in regard to gcp 
global contracts and global facilities 
in a february  th meeting with wanda curry  scott mills  mark evans  and
other ees personnel  ees indicated that they were leaning towards utilizing
the global contracts database  we briefly discussed the global facilities
database  but we all have agreed to concentrate on the feasibility of the
contracts database first and leave the facilities implementation question for
a later date 
as a result of the above mentioned meeting  we have an ees demo set up for
tomorrow morning from  a  m    p  m  in order to give ees personnel a
 hands on  demonstration of the functionality of global contracts  a
portion of ees  s contracts include multiple commodities and staggering
agreement terms that global contracts is now unable to capture  therefore 
we will need to institute numerous system enhancements  with the co  operation
of global it  in order to process ees  contracts  the timing and it manpower
needs of these system enhancements will be discussed at our demo by global it
personnel 
if ees does agree to utilize global contracts and facilities we will need to
set up a separate ees maintenance group within global 
ees has informed us that they would like to do all of their contracts data
input  therefore  we anticipate the use of  global contracts personnel for
the training of ees  personnel  two global employees would be assigned to
work directly with ees  s personnel on a daily basis  the remaining global
contracts person would act as a  help desk  here on  to answer any global
contracts questions 
in regard to billing ees for the global contracts database assistance  we are
proposing the use of a  flat rate  monthly fee structure  similar to the one
utilized for bridgeline gas pipeline  we would also include a  start up 
fee to cover the cost of the initial it system enhancements 
donna consemiu and i will be the designated global contacts for ees in regard
to global contracts and facilities
