subject  doorstep expenses
per discussion with rac management  during the budget approval process rac  s
initial budget for doorstep was eliminated  consequently  we cannot accept
any charges from eas for travel expenses 
ted murphy indicated that rick causey stated at the inception of doorstep
that doorstep costs should be charged to the business unit subject to the
doorstep visit 
if you have any other questions  give me a call
