pls do the following asap 
introduce yourself to john and make sure he knows the most expeditiious ways
to get information regarding the content of the dpr and executive reports 
pls consider this request  i think it is a good idea to either put comments
on the corp dpr or each business unit should have their own summary executive
report that could give more detail
