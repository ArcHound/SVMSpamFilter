Subject updated  approval authorizations
larry 
the ena accounting groups have had wires for our nymex and otc margin calls
sent back due to improper signatures  the timely flow of these monies is a
vital component to our trading organization  i believe that these two items
fall under category  b  of the policy memo that was distributed  see email
below  and therefore should only require the signature of an accounting
director 
 b  those that are approved by an underlying contract or rac require an
accounting director approval of the payment and general ledger coding 
we have a contractual obligation to our brokers and otc counterparties to
provide margin according to the guidelines set forth in our agreements with
them  these margin calls  returns of margin are monitored and amounts
signed off on by the rac credit group  bill bradford  s area   backup from
the credit group should be and is included with each wire 
i would appreciate your consideration of the above arguments to facilitate
the movement of these monies on a go  forward basis  i will call you tomorrow
to discuss the possibility of having this change in effect for monday dec 
  thank you

subject  updated  approval authorizations
as mentioned in my previous memo regarding cash control standards  approval
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment  corporate
accounts payable is actively pursuing a  workflow  system to route invoice
images for approval and processing  this workflow solution will not be
implemented until early   in the interim  an approval process will be
implemented by ap and treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and
correct general ledger coding  effective monday  november  the following
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices  payment requests
and wire transfer requests that are       or greater 
 a  those not approved by an underlying contract or rac require two
approvals  a managing director approval of the payment  and an accounting
director approval of the general ledger coding 
 b  those that are approved by an underlying contract or rac require an
accounting director approval of the payment and general ledger coding 
in both examples above  supporting documentation must be attached  if not
attached  then the payment will not be processed 
to assist us with implementing this approval process  i  m requesting each of
you to accumulate signatures of the managing directors and accounting
directors in your business unit using the attached form  please forward this
information to larry dallman  jfr   by friday  november  th 
this new process becomes effective monday  november  th  it important to
provide this information or payments greater than       will not be
processed
