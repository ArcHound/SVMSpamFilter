subject  suggestions for floor meeting locations
the floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the it teams  between my operations teams dedicated to ea  egm and eim  i have roughly  employees in the enron building  do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e  mail message  or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of net works  i have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor  including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees  
 th floor  trading   employees egm risk  vol  mgmt   confirms  settlements and eim risk
 th floor  trading   employees egm risk  confirms  settlements  various products 
 st floor  trading   employees power risk  confirms  vol  mgnt   settlements and dpr and mpr teams
 nd floor  trading   employees gas risk  logistics  all regions   operational analysis
 th floor  employees gas vol  mgmt   settlements  and global services
also  given the fact that operations is a relative  newcomer  to enron networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group  i would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions    sally
