hi tammy 
please forgive me if this message is redundant  but i wanted to make a formal request for space for the commercial support functions for enron global markets  if possible  we would like to have space reserved in the lowest tower floor available since our commercial people will be on the  rd floor  as you are well aware  
i am estimating our needs as follows 
accounting personnel with no home on the  rd floor   price 
accounting personnel on  rd floor  no future guarantees    price 
energy ops personnel on  rd floor  no future guarantees    glover 
total potential desks needed on tower floor 
if at all possible  i would prefer that a total of  desks be held to include space for future growth 
thank you for your assistance
