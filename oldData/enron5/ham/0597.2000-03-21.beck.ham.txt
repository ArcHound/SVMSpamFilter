just want to give you a couple of updates 
the prototype of the market penetration window was shown to jennifer fraser
and chris gaskill yesterday  the overall response was very positive  based
on this  it will provide a firmer estimate for delivery of phase i by the end
of the week 
the cost for the d  b data has been reduced by   k after additional
negotiations  pursuant to that  the agreement was signed last week  the
requested data was received yesterday 
                      forwarded by mary solmonson  hou  ect on

just wanted to let you know a few updates 
  we have a full it team now ready to go  we are going to prototype the
first window  market penetration  the prototype will give us something with
sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on
functionality  hopefully  we will have something in  weeks 
  the previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from
the prototype  the estimates are     m for phase i and     m for remaining
phases 
  included in the cost estimate is a figure of   k for the purchase of
customer prospect data from dun  bradstreet  the   k is an o  m expense
amount that was not included in the  budget  this amount combined with
other amounts ena did budget for or will spend with d  b results in an overall
budget impact over the next  months of   k 
i spoke with george wasaff in strategic sourcing this morning at the request
of philippe bibi  george has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from
d  b  either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate
better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with d  b  this
could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready
to go for implementation  i believe i can give george some time to try
something  but when it comes down to it    k isn  t that much money 
therefore  i suggest that if we don  t have anything negotiated in the next
three weeks  we sign the current proposal from d  b and move forward  d  b
is currently threatening  a negotiation tactic  i think  to pull their
development resources off of this project until they receive a signed
agreement  in the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our
delivery of global entelligence  we can provide a letter of intent to keep
them moving or sign the proposal at that time 
give me a call at    if you have any comments on any of the above items
