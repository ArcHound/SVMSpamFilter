per our conversation a week or so ago  i am forwarding a file to you which
provides the hours worked during the month of may for each activity performed
in the confirmation process  these hours are for multiple rc  s across the
various functions that are in energy operations  the hours are provided by
the people responsible for the rc  s  however  in many cases are rough
estimates  the data provided is directionally correct 
the excel file attached has several tabs  when you open the file you should
at the confirmation tab 
if you have any questions  need any clarification or would like to set up a
time for us to walk you through the information  please call me at ext  
or shari mao at ext

attached is a spreadsheet that highlights the number of hours that are spent
on activities per rc  i  ve only created custom views for risk management 
confirmations  and settlements  vm and lo are gas specific  and the other
functions are deemed non  energy operational core processes 
let me know if you have any questions about the data 
thanks
