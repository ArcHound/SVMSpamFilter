   the third time is a charm  after  failed adoptions  god has blessed me
with a beautiful daughter  emily lyn was born on saturday  july  at   
am in san antonio  she weighed  lbs  and measured  inches  she is so
tiny and has a head full of dark hair  i brought her home last night at   
pm  our first
night went well even if i didn  t get any sleep  it  s going to take some time
for me to get used to the noises she makes  i must admit  there were
days when i never thought this would happen  i appreciate all the kind words
of encouragement many of you have shared over the last few years
as i have gone through this process  especially during the really low
points  i am truly blessed 
i will be out of the office for a while but feel free to stay in touch as i  m
sure i  ll be logging in often  also  if i left someone off the list here 
please have them forgive me  remember  i  m working on  sleep  please feel
free to pass this along to anyone i may have fogotten  thanks
