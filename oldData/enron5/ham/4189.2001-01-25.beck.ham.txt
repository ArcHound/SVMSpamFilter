Subject sec var
gary and georgeanne let me know that all but  shares of eog are hedged
 without the eog leg  the cerberus total return swap is really only a loan 
and its var is about   thousand   i have recalculated  and the total
return swaps var fell to   million in december and   million in
november  december var is still up substantially from november  and the
primary reason now is that since natural gas prices are up so much  the value
of the bammel looper and mid texas total return swaps has increased  the
more money we make  the more we can potentially lose
