Subject university of texas mccombs school of business
the following memo will be hand delivered to you in hard copy form on tuesday
morning  feb    we will enclose the pledge form and
an enron matching gifts form for your convenience 
our meeting with bob may  dean of the mccombs school of business at
ut  austin  was a great success  we had  attendees who received an update
from bob about the many great things going on in austin  as well as
opportunities to participate in the   we   re texas   capital campaign 
after bob   s presentation  the  enron officers met separately and were
extremely supportive about the idea of contributing in a coordinated manner
to the mccombs school  this was evidenced by an expression of intent in
giving totaling about     from just the  people 
here is what we propose and how it would work 
  the ut alumni at enron would pledge   million over four years to the
mccombs school  this would consist of     of gifts from employees and a
matching     from enron 
  the matching program provided through the mccombs gift to the business
school would match the   million 
  the result would be a permanently endowed   million   enron chair   to
support   star quality   faculty for the school  this will represent one of
the largest faculty chairs at the business school 
a few additional details 
  each individual   s contribution will also be credited to their name  along
with the enron match  for recognition purposes in business school   s annual
report  president   s associates  etc  in other words  a     contribution
matched by enron will be considered as a     contribution by that
individual for recognition purposes 
  enron has agreed to not count it   s match against an employee   s annual
matching gift limitation of      as long as the gift is coordinated in a
way that makes it a part of the   enron chair   
  the gift may also be counted toward any previous pledge made to the  however  the leadership of the group will determine our
success 
thanks for your consideration and continuing support of the university of
texas
