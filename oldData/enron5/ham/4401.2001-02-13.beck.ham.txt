note   the bod directed us to combine some limits for some businesses  so
your individual commodity limits may become sub  limits subject to a larger
combined limit  for example    combine equity  convertible arbitrage  and
financial instruments  i  r and f  x    combine softs  grains  and meats  and
potentially other newer businesses as well   we will work with you as these
higher level limits are being developed 
note   cross  commodity trading authority was not pre  approved for anyone in
the company  authority to trade a commodity for which you are not the
authorized trader must be obtained from the business unit office of the
chairman for the commodity group that is authorized to trade that commodity 
with appropriate reporting as noted below 
policy amendments were as follows 
u clarify the cross  commodity trading policy to specify that trading limits
are to be applied against enron   s consolidated commodity positions on an
individual commodity group basis  enron   s consolidated daily position report
should provide required market risk disclosures by primary commodity group 
 for example  enron   s exposure to the north american natural gas market shall
be aggregated across the company  
  delegate cross  commodity trading approval among established commodity
groups to the respective business units offices of the chairman  with
appropriate reporting to the enron corp  chief risk officer 
u specify the operational control requirement that all trades executed over
the telephone must be recorded electronically 
below are relevant excerpts from the revised policy addressing the
cross  commodity trading guidelines  i will distribute the entire updated
policy as soon as we incorporate the bod  s comments 
v  operations and controls 
b  position reporting 
    for purposes of limit monitoring and aggregation of enron   s consolidated
trading results  enron   s consolidated daily position report should include
the net open position  maturity  gap position  profit or loss  and potential
exposure  var  for approved commodity groups consolidated across the company
without regard to which business unit undertook the trading activity  in
those instances where limits are granted to a business unit for a basket of
commodities  reporting for individual commodity risk books shall be
maintained to facilitate aggregation of enron   s actual consolidated commodity
specific exposure  management reporting may separately provide business unit
sub  limit monitoring and trading results aggregated according to management
lines  
e  transaction approval and execution   only those employees designated by
the enron corp  chief risk officer or his designee  s  will be authorized to
enter into transactions on behalf of enron  the chief risk officer must also
maintain a record of those employees responsible for the individual commodity
groups  commodity group manager  as specified in the appendices  individuals
will be assigned as commodity leaders to manage enron   s aggregate position
across the company as determined necessary by the chief risk officer    
vi  policy amendment authority
b  cross  commodity position authorization  if in the ordinary course of its
business an enron business unit or trading desk incurs an exposure to an
underlying commodity or financial instrument for which it does not have
explicit authority to carry  this exposure should be hedged internally with
the appropriate enron desk  s   with appropriate notification to the chief
risk officer or his designee  s   hedge positions should be in instruments
that have an observable correlation with the underlying exposure  and should
be rebalanced regularly to substantially neutralize the underlying exposure 
upon notification to the chief risk officer or his designee  s   the enron
business unit office of the chairman who has authority for that commodity
group may authorize a specific trader in a different commodity group to take
speculative positions with other enron trading desks in commodities and  or
financial instruments other than those which that trader has explicit
authority to trade  i  e  the business unit office of the chairman for north
american natural gas may authorize a trader in the coal group to trade gas
with the north american natural gas desk   for limit monitoring purposes
of enron   s consolidated trading results  these cross  commodity positions
shall be captured by individual commodity to facilitate aggregation and
reporting of enron   s consolidated exposure by commodity in the daily position
report  coal desk   s gas position will be aggregated with the north american
natural gas commodity group
