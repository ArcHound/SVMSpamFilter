Subject commoditylogic financial invoice exchange vl  
the fix module vl   is now operational and meets all the specifications as
shown in the frs  the team would be happy to show you a demo at your
convenience  perhaps early next week  we anticipate our back office using
fix in parallel with existing systems for december   and then using fix
 under fire  for january  invoices 
the demo uses actual data from sempra  our largest volume natgas financial
counterparty  in about a minute  fix is able to compare enron data and
sempra data  received electronically as an excel spreadsheet and stored on a
mini version of our deal database   immediately matching about  of the
 deals  it then helps the user to manually match those  deals that the
primary match engine could not  this whole process  if it were purely
manual  would take more than a day  using excel spreadsheets  and sort
functions   enron currently spends  to  hours per month matching sempra
invoices  fix allows the user to perform all matching in about  minutes 
our next deliverable is the confirm central module vl    due  december  we
anticipate delivering it on time  as we have with fix 
all the best
