subject  eol for japan
as you are probably aware  we are looking at a roll out time for bringing the
international commodities on eol to japan before the end of this month  we
have planned for a public rollout between    may  the mailout for this is
expected to be sent out the third week of april 
as all the products initially posted will be handled through the singapore
books  we need to make sure everything is in line  we will not be offering
any domestic products until probably third quarter  legal has been reviewing
the nature and form of the japanese law and has found that in its current
form we should be able to roll out the system without too much difficulty 
we will be using standard international contract forms which you would expect
the cp  s in japan to be comfortable with  in addition to your support for
the range of petroleum products  sydney will also quote your usd prices in
yen  i spoke with hickerson last week and they are making preparations for
this  with sydney only  hour ahead  this allows shane to provide real time
support throughout the business day in japan 
i would suggest that we have a call in the next day or so to further
discuss  would tomorrow at  pm sydney time work  i believe that this is
noon your time  if this doesn  t work let me know so that we can adjust 
thanks 
joe
