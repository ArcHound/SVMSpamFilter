quarter  end process 
final quarter  end information is due to my team by  pm on wednesday  july
 th

for divisions reporting p  l for july  rd and  or july  th  a  special dpr 
will be issued on july  th  this  special dpr  will not have a year  to  date
column  this is due to the fact that quarter  end information will not be
completed prior to issuing the  special dpr   for consolidated dpr
purposes  july  rd and july  th will be combined and reported as one day 
these combined days will be reported as july  th  please report each of
these days separately  once the final quarter  end dpr is completed  the
regular dprs for july business will be updated and reported  replacing any
 special dprs  previously reported  this process is necessary to enable
reporting of current daily information until the final quarter  end dpr is
finalized

process is greatly appreciated
