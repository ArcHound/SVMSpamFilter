please make sure that someone in the dpr  houston team gets these memos as
well 
i would recommend copying mike moscoso on any notices that you send me 
i am sure that it is confusing  but eventually we will get it right 
thanks

bp  you were going to send the limit violation memo previously forwarded to
t murphy on apx as well  ie  p  l   it will be easier to get this from you as
murphy is out on business  when do you expect to complete the memo for the
incremental   mm  loss on the apx positions to be run through today  s dpr 
going forward  make sure to copy both port and i on this and similar items 
thanks
