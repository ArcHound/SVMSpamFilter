subject  leadership development pilot
good news regarding the ena leadership curriculum  through the help of a
vendor selection team from eops  we  ve chosen southwest performance group and
wilson learning products as one of our primary vendors for the leadership
curriculum and programs  we are ready to conduct a pilot on february    of
six modules  the purpose of the pilot is to evaluate for fine  tuning the
wilson learning materials and facilitators and to present just a portion of
the leadership curriculum 
in order to evaluate the materials thoroughly  it would be great to get a
cross  section of ena to attend  we are asking that you invite several
supervisors from your client groups to participate in any of the courses
listed below  the sessions will be held in room  and times are listed
below  also attached is a description of the modules  all are designed for
supervisors only  with the exception being  communicating effectively   this
is open to any employee  as a benefit in attending the pilot  i will pick up
the cost   so there will be no charge back for their attendance 
we are currently completing the curriculum design and will have information
on the full curriculum available in february  this will include options
other than  classrom setting  for development 
please respond back to gracie presas by february  with your names  if you
have further questions  please contact me at     we are really excited
that we have this available and hope that your clients will find it to be
valuable 
the following are half  day sessions  supervisors may sign up for any or all
depending on their need  it would be helpful if supervisors attend a minimum
of two modules
