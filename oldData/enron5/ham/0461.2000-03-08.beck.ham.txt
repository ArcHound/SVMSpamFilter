Subject transitional assignments
please note this is confidential at this point 
to document what we discussed by phone  i met with sally beck and brent price
today  fernley dyson has a vacancy that he is attempting to fill  but it may
be  to  months before the position is up and running  to accomplish the
need in the meantime  sally and brent have agreed to share the duties as
follows 
brent  april  to june 
sally  june  to august 
they are traveling to the uk the week of    and would like to schedule some
time with you on either monday afternoon or wednesday  please let us know
what is good for you 
issues 
housing  they will each be bringing their families with them  brent  spouse
and  small children  the baby will need a crib  sally  husband and 
children  ages    and    i understand that the houses which have been
vacated due to returning expats have all been filled  so can you have someone
arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them 
immigration  due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and
have made trips already  i feel it would be best to apply for work permits
versus using the visa waiver  i have sent them the forms and requested that
brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his
sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk  i have informed him that he
should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april
 
tax  please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the
short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit 
benefits  i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and
benefits and  if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent
in the us  they may claim the excess on the expense report 
per diem  we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size 
let me know of any other issues we need to address  as always  i appreciate
your help
