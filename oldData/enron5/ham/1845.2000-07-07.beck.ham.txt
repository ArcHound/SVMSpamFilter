fyi  here are details on the approach joel is taking to draft a strategic
systems plan  what he doesn  t mention is that after the initial information
gathering  we hope to synthesize and make recommendations for where more
focus should occur  what projects should potentially be slowed or halted 
what projects can be leveraged across multiple business units  and what new
initiatives  technology should be initiated and explored  in addition to
sally  s direct reports  joel also plans to make contact with other business
units as well including richard sage in london 
let me know if you have any comments or suggestions

greetings sally  during the next week and a half  we will begin the process
of collecting information which will be used to write the strategic systems
plan  basically  the strategic systems plan will be used to identify several
areas of opportunity within each business unit such as 
each business units overview and the role technology plays in their area
current trends in each business area
using technology to help you achieve corporate goals  objectives
current departmental  business unit goals
using technology help you achieve departmental goals  objectives
projected business growth in twelve    to eighteen    months 
current technology being used
mission critical applications
it resources which are available
business continuity plans  bcps 
do you have any technology projects underway 
current projects
top  priorities
how are it projects and  or computer requests tracked
desired  future projects
issues  concerns
the following process will be used to accomplish this 
a cover letter with a questionnaire explaining what we wish to accomplish and
the process will be emailed to each of your direct reports
an interview will be set up with each direct report  each meeting will be
scheduled for approximately  minutes 
results of the questionnaire and interview will be used to create a draft
report
the draft report will be distributed for comments
a final report with recommendations will be written and distributed 
i hope this process meets with your approval  i can be reached at  
thank you
