for uk power  this was not officialised because we had a curve shift for  
years which was made in error  for the dpr we put a  top side  adjustment
through but because of the time it would take to re calc no re calc was
performed  this should have been covered in the daily conference call  was it

for uk gas  i thought this issue was closed on the conference call  we used
the  th as our month end as a result of the way the month end fell  the guys
have now clicked the  officialised  button for the  th if it helps you  but
we did not use that data  there shouldn  t be anything materially wrong with
it though  
what i think this highlights is that we will have days where we do not
officialise and do not re run  in these circumstances we will put a top side
through  we therefore need a mechanism to communicate this top side and i
would request we get this in place as soon as possible  this has been
requested a few times before  
does this answer your questions

just received a note fron steve price that uk power was never approved for
close of business   oct  can you or someone in your group respond to that as
well as to my query as to the lack of approval for uk gas for close of
business on   sep   see below 
we are making a real effort here to understand why the risk controls groups
are not receiving data on a reliable basis and input from your group is
crucial 
thanks for your help
