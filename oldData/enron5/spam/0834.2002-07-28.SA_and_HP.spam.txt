carriers drowning in debt  such as global crossing and worldcom 
the future may be dim  but for those survivors of the industry
that have managed to remain on their feet  other companies  problems
mean opportunity  every major industry in the history of
the united states has experienced a similar transformation  from
the railroads in the late  s to the automakers in the mid   s
to the dot  coms at the end of the  th century  says robert
saunders  director of the eastern management group market
research firm  christopher
dean  cto of oss company eftia  says we are seeing all
the people that are the survivors  there  s all this pent  up money

as we write this report  our new recommendation
indiginet  inc   otcbb

rating of strong buy  aggressive growth

growth potential

over      share to over      share in late june  talk america
holdings previously had a market cap of only     million  but
today has a market cap of   million 
igtt curently has a market cap of     million 
using the talk model for potential growth  igtt could very well
be trading in the   range in only a few months  with a market
cap in excess of   million  this would be an increase of   
so you see why igtt has such great potential and the time is right
for investors to get in on the ground floor
