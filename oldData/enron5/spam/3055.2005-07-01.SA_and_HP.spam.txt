several factors affect your mortgage rate 
the amount of your loan can increase your interest rate if the amount financed exceeds the conforming loan
limits established  the conforming loan limit changes at the beginning of each year 
shorter loans  such as  year or  year note  can save you thousand of dollars in interest payments over
the life of the loan  but your monthly payments will be higher  an adjustable rate mortgage may get you started
with a lower interest rate than a fixed rate mortgage  but your payments could get higher when the interest rate changes 
a larger down payment – greater than    will give you the best possible rate  down payments of   or less should expect to pay a higher rate as you are starting with less equity as collateral  if you  ve got the cash now and want to lower your payments  you can pay on your loan to lower your mortgage rate  it  s a simple concept  really  in exchange for more money upfront  lenders are willing to lower the interest rate they charge  cutting the borrower  s payments  closing costs are fees paid by the lender  if you don ’ t want to pay all of the closing costs  expect a higher rate which will pay the lender additional interest over the life of the loan 
credit quality and debt  to  income  ratio affect the terms of your loan through fico score  if you have good credit and your monthly income far surpasses your monthly debt obligations  you will get approved at a lower interest rate  however  if your monthly income barely covers your minimum debt obligations  even if you have a credit report  you will not receive the lowest available interest rate

get your hands on some cash 
another way to make a refinance work for you is to refinance for more than the balance remaining on your old mortgage   in effect  tapping your home equity  or  cashing out   in mortgage speak  thanks to favorable rates  you may be able to do so without boosting your monthly outlay  for example  at      the payment on a        year fixed rate mortgage is      but at      that same payment lets you borrow nearly     more 
the best use for the extra cash is to pay off any higher rate loans you may have  let  s say that you are carrying a     car loan at   and making minimum payments on a     credit card balance at    your monthly payments on those debts would total    then assume you refinanced your mortgage  taking out an additional     to pay off your car and credit card loans  result  at      your additional monthly mortgage payment would total only    so you would come out   ahead           
of course  all the extra cash needn  t go for paying off debts  when the menards swapped their arm for a fixed rate last december  they also increased their mortgage load by      from     to      they used     of the proceeds to pay their refinancing costs and another     to pay off a   home equity loan  which had been costing them   a month  then they spent the remaining     to build a garage for roger  s antique car collection   and they did all this for just another   a month
