subject  you are not the only one who suffers from this pain
three studies assessed staphylococcal endocarditis    one study
assessed any staphylococcal infection  and one assessed streptococcal
endocarditis  treatment is well ingrained in
existing guidelines and clinical practice with these infections  so what
have i done about it  well its still a practicing effort  but i dont just
listen to what a man says  i look to see the connection in a mans actions 
are they putting as much of an effort into the relationship  do i feel that
they really feel what they say they are feeling  and to a fault  i am
skeptical at best that they truly mean what they say  our best ally is our
gut feeling c and we are very guilty of ignoring it  when we ignore it we
are destined to get hurt
