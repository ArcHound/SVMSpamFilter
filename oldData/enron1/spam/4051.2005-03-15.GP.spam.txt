breaking news  
april    montana oil and gas reports the following update on its
sylvan lake project  after several delays due to unseasonable weather and
road closures in the province of alberta  the contracted drilling rig
was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the        w  m
well  the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in
compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well
immediately there after 
the company  s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion
of tie in upon lifting of the road ban 
with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and
gas has prepared a detailed project description 
project history
the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late   s and
has produced over  million barrels  mbbls  of high quality crude oil
and  billion cubic feet  bcf  of associated natural gas 
predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations  the field
remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and
expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics 
the original freehold lease on section      w  m was leased to a major
oil company  as was most of the sylvan lake field itself  an
exploratory well was drilled by this major company in        w  m in  and was
abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely
eroded by post depositional cutting  as a consequence  the major company
did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the
complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the
deeper mineral rights  below the base of the jurassic formations  on the
west one half of section  back to the freehold mineral rights owner in
the early   s  this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as
mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more
specifically  not often by the major companies  accordingly  these mineral
rights sat available and dormant until the early   s as almost all oil
and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee 
through diligent land work  including field visits  our partners discovered
this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section   since
that time our partners have managed to lease an additional  acres
 one quarter section  of section   energy  has the right to earn  
of this prospect  possibly    with the drilling of a test well in
       w  m 
land discussion
our partners have secured a   working interest in the west half and
northeast quarter of section      w  m  the land comprises some 
acres  one section or one square mile equals  acres   primary drilling
spacing in alberta is as follows  one quarter section spacing  
acres  for oil and one section spacing   acres  for natural gas  the
province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units
 called holdings  should you be able to prove to the province  s
satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased
well density  almost the entire sylvan lake field  pekisko pool  has
been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering
pekisko oil we will down space as well 
geological discussion
pekisko formation   the principle target of this prospect is oil and
associated gas production from the deeper  older  pekisko formation  the
sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the
pekisko formation  this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was
influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions  overlying
this ancient shoreline are cap rocks  impermeable layers  of the
mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous  jurassic impermeable
shales  these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and
account for billions of barrels of reserves 
production facilities discussion
this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas
over the past forty  five years  accordingly a multitude of gas gathering
and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been
constructed 
a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our
project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed
drilling location  the capacity of the processing facility is
approximately  mmcf  d with current throughput of only  mmcf  d  accordingly 
excess capacity of  mmcf  d exists in the facility which would be in
the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible 
this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the
transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of
red deer  alberta  accordingly  trucking costs would be minimal to get
oil product to the transportation system
