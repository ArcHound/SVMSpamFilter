the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding  much food is in the tillage of the poor but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment  whoso is simple  let him turn in hither and as for him that wanteth understanding  she saith to him  let thine eyes look right on  and let thine eyelids look straight before thee  a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken
