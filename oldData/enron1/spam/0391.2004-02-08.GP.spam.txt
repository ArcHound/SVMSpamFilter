music archiving and retrieval  music querying  music production  music profiling 
etc  in the current internet and multimedia age many other applications are
strongly getting the market attention and most of them will become more diffuse
of the present applications in short time  end users have discovered the multimedia
experience  and thus  the traditional music models are going to be replaced by
their integration with multimedia  audio visual  cross media  at present  there is
a lack of music notation  representation standard integrated with multimedia  the
aim of this workshop is to make a further step to arrive at standardizing a music
notation  representation model and decoder integrated into the mpeg environment

formats for multimedia consumers
