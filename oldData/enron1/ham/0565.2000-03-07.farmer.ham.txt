 subject  monday evening  s gas flow

 the natural gas pressure issue was attributed to  hpl values  the north
 one was not operative and the south one had leaking bellows 
 it was determined that an alternator supply for pressure contract was not
 readily available  being that it was after normal work hours 

 th hpl technician determined that he would be able to make repairs while
 the
 line was operative  and that it would not be necessary to request a
 shut  in
 condition  it would just take longer for him to make the repairs  the
 technician was able to control the pressure through the south valve while
 repairing the north valve 

 hpl agreed to the utilities department  s request that the technician was
 not
 to leave lcr  s facility this evening until such time as both valves were
 operative
