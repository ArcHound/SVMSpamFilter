Subject txu lone star
i am working on clearing an old txu lone star  gas distribution balance from
   and     we originally billed txu on nominated quantities and they
have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments  these are brokered deals where
we sold to txu and purchased from exxonmobil and highland  txu has provided
meter support since the deals were on lone star pipeline  however  i am
unsure how to have volume management reallocate 
for example  we originally sold    mmbtu on      to txu and purchased
   mmbtu from highland energy and    mmbtu from exxonmobil  txu shows
the total amount of gas on      was    mmbtu  how should the purchase
piece be allocated between exxonmobil and highland since this was a brokered
deal
