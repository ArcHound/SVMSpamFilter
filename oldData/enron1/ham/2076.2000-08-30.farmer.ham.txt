deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of january   the
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned
turnaround 
it is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown 
please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer 
thanks
