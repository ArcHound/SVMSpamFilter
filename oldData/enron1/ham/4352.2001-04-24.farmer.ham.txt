as in my email below to daren  we are seeing some oa variances between flash to actual on the ple contracts on pgev for         i have verified with thu nguyen of what the statements from pgev show and that is also what we have booked in unify and recorded to the g  l as an imbalance  however  when looking in cpr  under cpr pipeline exchange   there was not anything flashed for those months  thus our oa variance  i seem to remember that stacy once said that although we may run an imbalance at the end of a month on occassion  in those few times that we do    it should be relatively small and   in the following days of the next month  we should have worked the imbalance down to zero thus having no imbalance at the end of the month  in a voice mail from daren today  he seemed to think the same thing was happening or even that by the end of each month  we were balanced to zero  can you shed some light on these months and let me know if we should have had an imbalance and if we should have  why there would have not been anything flashed  if we should not have had an imbalance  then we  ll need your help to figure out what went wrong in that pgev shows an imbalance on their statements  let me know what you think         
thanks

when i look back in cpr for the delivery periods of        on cpr pipeline exchange  i do not see anything being flashed as an imbalance  i  e  the buys and sales always equal in cpr  however  we are booking an imbalance every month on the parking and lending contract  should there be something in cpr for these volumes  let me know because it is causing an oa variance for us  thanks
