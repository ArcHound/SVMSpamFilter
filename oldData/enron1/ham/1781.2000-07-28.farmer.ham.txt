panenergy purchase  deal   
gas in the amount of  mmbtus for april lst was purchased from panenergy on
deal   
however  scheduling has indicated that they have no sale for that gas on day
one and as a result  it is not pathed in the system 
could you please review this item and see if it should or shouldn  t be a sale
so that scheduling can either path april lst or i can dispute the volume
being billed to us by pan energy 
this is part of pan energy  s exchange deal

as i told thu before  see below   i did not see any volumes for that deal
in     i think this volume is some residue that flow from the last day in
march and probably should be allocated to that month  i dont show a deal to
purchase or sell that gas in april  if you have any more questions please let
me know  thanks
