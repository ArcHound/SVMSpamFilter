i need the above referenced contract put into pops for january  may  june 
july  and august  forward  i need the contract in pops for august
forward because i never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself 
in  a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline  south
texas  l  p  with a synergi contract number      and a global number
of  by karen lambert  per karen this old agreement was terminated by
dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect  in   when copano began
allocating line gain to themselves again i contacted lauri  karen  and
yourself to see if i could get the contract in pops  karen sent me an e  mail
indicating that she set  up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase 
global    i don  t have a  synergi  contract number   i know that in
   lauri contacted bernard widacki at copano to discuss this issue 
i need lauri to review this and then i need the contract to be put in pops so
that i can correctly allocate the gas at this meter  i have not allocated
any line gain in  and the volumes are small  karen is the most
knowledgeable about this contract  so i suggest that any questions be
directed to her regarding contract issues  karen worked with bernard widacki
at copano to set up the contract originally 
thanks
