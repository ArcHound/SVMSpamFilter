i received a call from carl drachenberg with hms at approximately    pm on
     stating that he pulled a stick on meter   and it was wet and
flowing at  lb  i asked gary hanks what we want to do and he said to have
carl notify the producer and shut it in  i notified carl and he got in
touch with the producer and they shut the compressor down at approx   pm on
   and at that time there wasn  t any flow  carl came back out there at 
am on    and closed the valve and removed the chart  there was no flow
after they shut the unit down and it was flowing between  and  mcf
