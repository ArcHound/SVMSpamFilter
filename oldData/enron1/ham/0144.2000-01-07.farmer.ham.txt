susan 
hope you had a great new year and holiday season  i have a couple of issues
i want ot clear up for this year  s contract 
the question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you
are currently pulling gas  our new contract that was just sent to you has a
minimum take of    mmbtu  estimated      celanese      
texas city  and      dodge street   if you undertake at any meter
excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire   
mmbtu  my accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the
two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out  we discussed
this on the phone and i got your consent to split these invoices  now we are
being told all three invoices need to be separate  since we always aim to
please the customer  here is my recommendation for handling the contract
through it  s term  please let me know if this is fine 
celanese    mmbtu  d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
   hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
texas city    mmbtu  d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
   hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
dodge street    mmbtu  d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
   hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
any excess volumes taken at all three locations would be billed  gd hsc high
 day after
