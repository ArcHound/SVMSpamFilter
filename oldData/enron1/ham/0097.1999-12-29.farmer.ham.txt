gas control has some line work scheduled for        that will affect the
referenced point  dynegy has nom  d  at this point which i  m assuming
they  ll want baseload for january  the desk also appears to have some gas
nom  d out here  approx  mm   rather than cut these volumes  would you
try to negotiate with koch not to flow this gas during the outage  but to
make it up as soon as the outage is over  they may be able to begin flow on
     please let me know as soon as possible 
thanks
