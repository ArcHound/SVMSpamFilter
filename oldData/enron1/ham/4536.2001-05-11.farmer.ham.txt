george 
the following are my answers to your questions 
  no 
  the nomination is at the pay meter  
  in the past  this purchase has not been listed on the spreadsheet  it has been maintained by the risk group 
  as of       comstock  s nomination is    and kerr mcgee  s is    
  this purchase is not listed on the spreadsheet  it is maintained separately on a file by daren  to the best of my knowledge it is a good wellhead purchase

questions based on the information in the facilitation by location report 
  meter  hgpl  hpl  stratton  tejones operating corporation  sitara   should this purchase be at meter   freeman prod  maxine field in trade zone  
  i presume we are not counting both meter  north padre island blk  and meter  lehman  spinnaker onshore  isn  t this the same gas 
  meter  seahawk  a  s  mat plt    eog resources  sitara   is this purchase properly in the wellhead book 
  meter  pgtt junction   lease  comstock oil  gas  inc  and kerr  mcgee oil  gas onshore l  p   sitara  and   comstock  s volume should exceed kerr  mcgee  s volume  and together the two volumes should be approximately     d  currently  comstock  s volume is only     d and kerr  mcgee  s volume is     d  we look about     d short 
  meter  hannah nash  coral energy resources  l  p   sitara   is this purchase properly in the wellhead book 
i  m looking at about  other old deals that i think should be in for may  but aren  t  in addition  i  m adding in the new deals that will flow in may  i  ll be done by noon
