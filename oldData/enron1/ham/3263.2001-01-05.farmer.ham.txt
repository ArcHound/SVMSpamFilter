Subject tenaska iv   
i am having trouble with the transport deal for the tenaska iv contracts on
lone star  we have deal  in sitara for meter  at a    
transport rate  we received the statement from txu lone star and it does not
agree with our deal  they are billing for meter  at     and meter
 at      these meters relate to the tenaska iv sale deal 
and the tenaska marketing deal   respectively  should our deal match
what txu is billing or is there another deal that i am missing  i haven  t
worked with transport very much  so i could be confused  i think we have
this problem with oct   also  but i have not reviewed it yet  i am going
to look at it this afternoon  tenaska iv has already reimbursed us for the
txu transport  so we will need to pay this next week 
also  now that we have the actuals for nov   we need to update the demand
fees to reflect the correct volumes  barring any changes  i have listed the
adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet  the unify adjustments will be
over by about     from the spreadsheet  i thought it would be better have
the cleburne desk at zero  than to leave a balance 
  deal   change    demand fee from       to      
 difference       
  deal   change    demand fee from       to      
 difference       
  deal   change agency fee volume from     day to     day
 difference     
thanks
