subject  mobil discrepancies
lee 
here are some specific situations i am trying to resolve regarding volume on
centana 
purchase from mobil 
    the purchase by hplr for    mms in deal  was never billed by
mobil 
 a purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in
sitara  
per our conversation friday  it sounds like hplc does owe mobil for his
gas  right 
sale to mobil 
    per the pipe statement provided by greg bonin for centana volumes 
  
flowed in january  i billed    and mobil paid it 
logistics said    of the gas that flowed was not our sale to mobil
because
the gas wasn  t scheduled  in addition  if the    were a sale to mobil 
the
point would not be in balance in the system  the source of    of the
gas
says they only sold    mms and not any more  no other sources are in the
system 
i assume if the    wasn  t consumed by mobil  they wouldn  t have
paid for it  is there storage involved here  if so  whose storage and how
did it work 
there are sales in other months with discrepancies on centana with smaller
volumes
than in     once i understand what happened in january  maybe that will
help me
with the other months 
please let me know if there is any other information you need from me
relating to
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this  i
can bring
the pipe statements to you if that would help 
thanks
