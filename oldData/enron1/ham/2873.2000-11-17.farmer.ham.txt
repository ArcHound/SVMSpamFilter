Subject retro assignments
this is a follow up to the conversation you had with pat yesterday and to
reiterate retro contract assignments  we have decided to go back to the old
process of handling contract assignments mid  month  this means that if we
receive an assignment from legal after the  th workday  that assignment will
become effective for current month the following month  for example  if i
receive a notice from whomever that xyz has been assigned to abc on     
for an legal effective date of     i will create a new deal from   
forward  on the new deal the currect month will be zeroed out under the
expected volumes  bob would not start nominating this new deal until    
leaving        to be moved by volume mangement 
if this is not a clear understanding from all parties  please let me know 
rita  if this becomes burdensome on your group  please let me know and we
will readdress this issue 
thanks
