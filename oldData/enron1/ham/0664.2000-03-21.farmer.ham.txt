this is an outside measured volume that we don  t receive volumes on until
month  s end so systematically  no information equals zero  spi  the software
vendor for mips is investigating all of the rules currently in place for file
transfers  particularly  volumes  the only possible solution is to tag all
zero volumes sent in the nightly file process as  i  incomplete  i will let
you know the outcome of this investigation and the monies required to
complete  we may require a work order to complete based on the outcome of the
investigation

where is measurement in the process of sending pipeline operations more
complete data  we continue to have this problem at various bidirectional
meters and meter  below is the latest casuality  when mips sends
pipeline operations a zero prelim  this becomes the best available number and
overlays the estimate that gas control sends us  when this happens 
scheduling doesn  t catch to override the zero  the desk  s expense is
understated  this is causing a huge mess for texas operations  what is the
plan to move this up on measurements priority list  we need an answer asap  
charlotte 
at what other meters are we having this problem

i spoke with romeo d  souza this morning regarding the on  going problem of
mips feeding zeros to pops when incomplete data is received 
in light of the e  mail below regarding how important it is that we receive
accurate data from mips     could you please update me on the status of
this correction 
thank you so much

in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers  i discovered that valero texoma
    bav volumes have not fed into pops since    causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of    mm month to date  the more critical part of
this problem  however  is that pops has fed  volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals  this means that these purchase volumes  expenses  have
not been picked up in tom  s p  l and are  instead  sitting in ua   to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua  value  the p  l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through 
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin  however  a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it  s discovered 
someone needs to be overriding the  volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p  l is kept as accurate as possible 
please give me a call if you have any questions
