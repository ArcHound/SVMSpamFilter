hi daren 
i  m attempting to clear the above mentioned meter from an error report
 revenue volume comparison report   howard apprised me  in a meeting last
week  that the reason this meter is appearing in the aforementioned report is
due to no volumes being scheduled in pops but volumes appearing in mops  the
volumes  this meter is for   sitara deal tickets  and   due
to this being a  check meter  the volumes will not bridge to pops from mops 
i  d like to request to revise the nome of  to show    instead  can you
approve this modification 
thanks
