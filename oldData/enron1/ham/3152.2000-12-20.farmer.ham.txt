we billed wyman gordon  mmbtus at     in sept  
i spoke with richard moran at wyman gordon and he indicated that he has not
had any physical gas deals with us in over a year and does not owe us the
      we billed him for september 
can you please validate if this is his gas or if this deal ticket should have
been linked to some type of financial deal 
thanks  katherine
