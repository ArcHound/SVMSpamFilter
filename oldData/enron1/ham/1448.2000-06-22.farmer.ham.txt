each month at seven oaks  teco  pg meter no   
greg  this relates to the seven oaks tailgate accounting issue we have been
discussing  hplr once had an appropriate agreement in place  but that
agreement has been assigned to ect  until the agreement can be re  assigned
from ect to hplc  we will use spot gtcs to clear the puchase  sale accounts
for the period from    to    or perhaps

in   a contract was drawn up between hplr and teco gas processing 
contract numbers             in april    these contracts
were assigned to ect  in october of   these contracts should have been
assigned to hplc  but did not get assigned  beginning in jan     negative
volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under sitara
   meter     causing my payments to be reduced  i believe that the
deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract   the
purchase deal numbers which i have been using are sitara   and sitara
    both these sales and purchases  since october    are suppose to
be for hplc  donald reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale gtc  s
between teco and hplc can be set up from october of  until the master
contract is changed  amelia alland has set these up  which i believe
terminate in october    the gtc spot contract numbers are as follows 
purchases        global 
sales        global 
per our conversation earlier can you make these retroactive adjustments 
when complete  can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be

information
