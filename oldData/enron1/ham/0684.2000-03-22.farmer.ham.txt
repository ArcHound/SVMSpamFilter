we do not have deal to enter for this  you need to look at the entire midtex
line for each of the days that are out of balance  if we are short at katy 
i would think that we would be long at dewville   many times  our receipts
from the midtex line at katy are offset by our deliveries to tufco at the
tap   this should help you fix the january problem  also  for december  you
may need to ask pg  e where they show the delivery for western  is it at hpl
katy  as our records show  or is it at pge  s another point on the midtex
line  in any case  we don  t have deliveries to make  the only other remedy
is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance

we are still having problem with this meter  from what i understand of our
conversation a week or two ago  hpl needs to take the swing to keep the other
contracts whole  in the case where we have excess flow the hpl  r  contract
takes the swing  so in the case where we are short  shouldn  t we have a hpl
 d  contract to take the swing  please let me know if this will work  i
need to get back with settlement today  thanks
