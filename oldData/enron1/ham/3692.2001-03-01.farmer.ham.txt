Subject flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl
saturday  march   the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately  mmbtu  dy  this
change should continue through march  th or  th  the reason for the change
is an operational emergency  defs typically delivers approximately 
mmbtu  dy into txu lone star  this delivery will not be able to occur
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance 
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march  the
busby compressor will compress the usual  mmbtu  dy of fuels cotton
valley redelivery gas as well as the  mmbtu  dy of txu lone star
redelivery gas  a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being
established and should be available by march  th or  th  at this point in
time  we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points  therefore  defs will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans  after
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are
volume balanced  it is our intent to have redeliveries of  mmbtu  dy
from fuels cotton valley and  mmbtu  dy into pg  e  which is what is in
place effective       for eastrans
