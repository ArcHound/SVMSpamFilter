i don  t want to tell you to add any contracts  because i am not sure about
that  i am just saying if you look at ray  s schedule there are  deals out
there  one is a purchase from ena and the other a purchase from dynegy  the
track id i gave you was for ena  you cannot allocate the dynegy piece
until i give you a track id  i cannot give you a track id until the deal is
extended for days    and

you did not allocate this according to ray  s schedule  the track id i gave
you was only for the purchase from ena  you need to extend the deal for the
purchase from dynegy  you put all of the volume on these  days on ena 
that is not what is on ray  s schedule  so we are still out on the
interconnect report

your allocation is correct with the exception of days    and    where
strangers gas is allocated  i have created an accounting arrangement for
these days and the new track id for ena is   please allocate the ena
portion according to rays schedule for these  days  deal   purchase
from dynegy  needs to be extended for these  days so i can do an accounting
arrangement  alfonso i need for you to allocate your meter daily  because
we have tiered pricing this month 
thanks
