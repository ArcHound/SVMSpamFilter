Subject fw  the odds are against them
there is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we  ve all
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks  but when you look at the
following numbers and realize how much worse it could  ve been  i guess there
are a lot of people who were saved   
subject  the odds are against them
by now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
and reports of the
destruction from the terrorist attacks on the us 
these were deplorable
acts
that we will never forget  but now is a time to look
at the other side of
the
numbers coming out of new york  washington and
pennsylvania  the sad
but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
media has not reported yet
 the survival rates and some positive news about
the attacks 
   the buildings   
 the world trade center 
the twin towers of the world trade center were
places of employment for
some
   people  with the missing list of just over
   people  that means
  of the people targeted survived the attack  a
  on a test is an  a  
 the pentagon 
some    people were the target of a third plane
aimed at the pentagon 
the latest count shows that only  lost their
lives  that is an amazing
    survival rate  in addition  the plane seems to
have come in too low 
too early to affect a large portion of the building 
on top of that  the
section that was hit was the first of five sections
to undergo renovations
that would help protect the pentagon from terrorist
attacks  it had
recently
completed straightening and blastproofing  saving
untold lives  this attack
was sad  but a statistical failure 
   the planes   
 american airlines flight 
this boeing  that was flown into the outside of
the pentagon could have
carried up to  people  yet only  were aboard 
luckily   of the seats
were empty 
 american airlines flight 
this boeing  could have had up to  people
aboard  but only carried
 
thankfully   of the seats were unfilled 
 united airlines flight 
another boeing  that could have sat  people
only had  people on
board  fortunately it was   empty 
 united airlines flight 
this boeing  was one of the most uplifting
stories yet  the smallest
flight to be hijacked with only  people aboard out
of a possible  had
  of its capacity unused  yet these people stood
up to the attackers and
thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
national landmark  saving
untold numbers of lives in the process 
   in summary   
out of potentially    americans directly
targeted by these inept
cowards    survived or avoided the attacks  that  s
a higher survival rate
than heart attacks  breast cancer  kidney
transplants and liver transplants
 all common  survivable illnesses 
the hijacked planes were mostly empty  the pentagon
was hit at it  s
strongest point  the overwhelming majority of people
in the world trade
center buildings escaped  and a handful of
passengers gave the ultimate
sacrifice to save even more lives 
pass this information on to those in fear and the
media  don  t fear these
terrorists  the odds are against them
