when will the buybacks and swings be set up for july  i am a little
concerned with the long weekend coming up  i believe that we agreed that
these would be set up by the  rd work day  which would be friday the  th 
 six days of flow   i definitely don  t think that we should any later  it
would be great if this could be handled sooner  miimizing our economic impact 
additionally  we need to get the industrial spreadsheet up and running
again  this report is very beneficial to gas control  industrial traders and
schedulers on call 
let me know what you think
