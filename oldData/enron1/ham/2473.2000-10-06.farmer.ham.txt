Subject re  duke cashout entries    and   
we did take into account the price adjustments you made  the actual purchase
cashout for    was        your pricing took care of most of the
cashout  but there was still a balance  the over delivery pricing per mmbtu
in the contract is the difference between hsc spot     and hsc index  so
gd     didn  t quite cover the entire cashout  i have attached the calc
sheet in case you need it
