i have reviewed the entex actuals and adjusted gas control  s entex factor for
the month of may  i have found that entex estimates have been overstated by
approximately    mmcf  day 
romeo 
will you make sure the estimates that are in pops are corrected to reflect
the new volumes  this should help reduce some of the ua  that daren and pat
are trying to locate 
the attached file has the changes that need to be made  please let everyone
on this mailing list know once the changes have been made 
if you have any questions please call me at  
thanks
