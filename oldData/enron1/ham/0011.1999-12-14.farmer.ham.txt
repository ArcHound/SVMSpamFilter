Subject king ranch
there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify
system 
  cage ranch  since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this
gas on king ranch  it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and
king ranch is re  delivering to stratton  it is also my understanding that
there is a   cent fee
to deliver this gas  we need a method to accomodate the volume flow on hpl
at meter  and   this gas
will not be reflected on trans  usage ticket   and   since it is
not being nominated from a processing agreement  we either  need to input
a point nom  on hpl or krgp  at these meters to match the nom at meter  
or a deal for purchase and sale  if king ranch is taking title to the gas 
needs to be input into sitara at these meters with the appropriate rate  i
have currently input a point nom on krgp to accomodate this flow  so we can
divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made 
  forest oil  there is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow
from the meter    into king ranch  it is my
understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had
their own processing agreement  i need confirmation that the gas from this
meter should be nominated on contract     and that this agreement
should have been reassigned to hplc   it is currently still under hplr  
if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement  then once
again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a
point nom or a sitara deal at meters  and
