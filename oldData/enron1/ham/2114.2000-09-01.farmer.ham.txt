sorry  i can  t remember if we had talked about this pricing issue or what 
were you looking into this issue for me or was it passed to someone else 
please see the email below  i believe the system is pulling in the wrong
price for waha  wtx  if  m  i   for    production  the deal  is  
i looked at the publication and it shows that the price should be     
the price of     plus   would equal the price of     which is what duke
is
claiming the price to be instead of what we are showing which is     
thanks  stephanie
