george  i  ve done some t  accounts  the bean counter in me  and i think the following is the best way to handle this going forward 
change the existing deals   and   to a zero price  this will eliminate the a  r balance on hpl  s books for glo  but will keep the volume nom  d to glo and will not impact ua  
enter a ticket on hpl for a sale to ena for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets  this should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be     for    and     for    
enter a ticket on ena where the ena  wellhead book purchases the demand from hpl  the amounts would be the same as in   above 
enter a ticket on ena where the ena  wellhead book sells demand to egm for the value of the crude oil for the prior month  for     the sale would be for        the    crude oil delivered to egm by glo   for     the sale would be for        the    crude oil delivered to egm by glo  
this will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward 
the price on the sale from hpl to glo will need to be zeroed out monthly 
the demand charges on steps  and  will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out 
the demand charges on step  will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to egm 
once this is done  the a  r balance for glo will be cleared  the margin will be on the ena wellhead book  and the intercompany transactions will move the money from egm to hpl  this needs to be done monthly prior to flash  which will prevent any oa variances  the index for the gas value is available shortly after the lst of the month  and since the volume is firm  there shouldn  t be a problem calculating the value  we should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ena to egm  if you have any questions or see a better way to do this  please let me know  thanks
