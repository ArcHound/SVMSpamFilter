Subject hplr liquids  humble gas pipeline
we need to get together this afternoon at    pm in room  to discuss how
we will schedule and allocate the hplr liquids coming into humble gas
pipeline at meter   karry  it is my understanding that you do not want
an intercompany sale from hplr liquids to hplc at this point  how do you
plan to get this gas to king ranch since hplr liquids does not have a
transport on humble 
daren  the intercompany hplc purchase is how it is set up currently in mops 
robert  since stella is out  we will need someone to represent logistics
