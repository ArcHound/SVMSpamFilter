janet and daren 
attached is a gas supply proposal i receive from duke energy for delivery to the mission interconnect on tetco  they also provided me a quote on tenn  but it was way off base  this deal in combination with swing from net may be a good start for the month of may  the deal provides swing flexibility and would allow us to get our feet wet and see how net operates the mission system when they are not providing all of the delivered gas  let me know what you think  i have had discussions with elpaso  pg thu   apr
