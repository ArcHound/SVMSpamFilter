you are correct  i did request a ticket at meter  as a spot purchase 
however  i  m not sure why the ticket was created in the name of coastal  it
should have been in the name engage energy us  lp  as for october  hplc is
buying this package of gas on a  spot  basis and a ticket should be created
and entered in to sitara 
thanks
