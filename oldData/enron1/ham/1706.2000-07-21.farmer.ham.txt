Subject re  saudi arabia
i spoke to mr  maldinado this morning and it doesn  t look good  he claims he
has a connection to the minister of  energy  who will allocate gas to him  i
asked where would the gas be delivered  and he said anywhere you want it 
short term or long term  again  anything you want  but probably long term is
better 
i pointed out that there isn  t an energy minister in saudi and would he know
the name of the minister whose giving him the gas  he stumbled and couldn  t
remember the name 
finally he said  what do you have to lose  just send me a letter requesting
gas with the specs  location and duration  and he  ll do his best to get it 
if you want to try it rob  he  s all yours  his fax number is      
address  grand avenue  bellflower  ca
