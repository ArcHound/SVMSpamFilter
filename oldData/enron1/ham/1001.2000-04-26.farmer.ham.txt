subject  resume for summer internship
april   
dear mr  mcconnell 
thank you for taking the time to consider this resume for a possible summer
internship with enron  i understand that you have spoken to my father  scott
wells at texaco  and he has informed me that enron accepts interns only when
a department asks for one 
i  d like to continue my education in the energy industry for a second summer 
i interned for dynegy last summer and learned many new concepts and terms
for working in the gas industry  i worked on the trading floor as a gas
scheduler  and after only a month i was controlling the northeast cng
pipeline  this helped because i really got to learn were many of the
northeast pipes are located and different pooling and connecting points 
other responsibilities were inputting numbers into the morning spreadsheet of
the gas bought and sold that morning  throughout the day i would work on
projects they needed completed and attend meetings that pertained to the
trading floor  it was all a great learning experience for me and i hope to
use my knowledge again this summer for enron 
i would appreciate your help in forwarding my resume to the proper human
resource personnel so that i might be able to contact him or her in hopes of
a future internship possibility  i will be available to have a start date of
may  th and be available for employment until school resumes in late august 
thank you for your time  and i look forward to hearing from someone in your
company at his  her earliest convenience  please feel free to call me at
      or email me at rollins   aol  com 
sincerely 
sean wells
