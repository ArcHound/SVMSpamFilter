Subject missing txu lonestar and oasis paths
stacey 
it looks like your missing paths revealed a quirk in our suppression of zero
paths  there were  paths initially entered as zero  then changed to
non  zero on a later date  the system did not correctly determine that the
zero path should no longer be suppressed 
we have fixed the  paths affected and have corrected the code so this won  t
happen any more  below is a screen print of the nov  problem that is now
fixed
