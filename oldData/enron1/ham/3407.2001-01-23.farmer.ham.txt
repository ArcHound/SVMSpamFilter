Subject texoma  beaumont interconnect
mobil says the low point of their takes will be during february will be from
feb  to   so any day in that time period would be a good time for hpl to
do the required maintenance at the texoma  beaumont system interconnect 
we need to define our game plan 
 what day to do the work
 how much gas hpl will deliver through our own meter
 how we use centana to deliver the rest of the hpl volumes
 if we had planned in feb to baseload some of our midcon obligation at mobil
as we have done in dec and jan  then we will need to do something different
whenever we do the maintenance
james  we are scheduled to meet with mobil in beaumont at    am thursday
feb   to go over the game plan with them 
pat  do you want anyone from hms to attend 
thanks
