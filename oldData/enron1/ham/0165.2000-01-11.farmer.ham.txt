revision  according to measurement  there is flow of    in     however 
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on hpl in oss  i
checked mips and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate
of    mmbtu 
daren is there a deal in cpr which may not have fed over to oss  i checked
oss for the whole year of  and there are no other deals in oss  it does
seem strange that this is the only month of flow 
thanks  stella
