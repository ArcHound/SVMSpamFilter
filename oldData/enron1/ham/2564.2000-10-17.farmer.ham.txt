i understand that you need a note for your files regarding the tenaska plant 
on saturday  october    at    am  the plant had a catastrophic
failure of the gas turbine  the entire plant is essentially shutdown until
these repairs can be made  this outage will last a minimum of  days  ken
riesz will keep you informed of our progress 
i hope this is what you need  let me know
