Subject golf
i just have to brag on myself as my game seldom affords me the opportunity 
sunday after church  tom knox and i played  holes at mimosa  the weather
was perfect  while my game stunk overall     i did manage par on one par
 and two par   s  the best was at     a  yard par   my drive was
 yards  the ground was flat    i was on the green three feet from the
pin in   and then two  putted  those three pars however will keep me going
back  remember  i had a witness 
thanks for listening to me brag  and no  don  t expect me to replicate these
feats on our next outing  hope all are doing well  we  re remembering
rachel and jake in our prayers each day
