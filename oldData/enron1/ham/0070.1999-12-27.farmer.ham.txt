Subject re  ua   meter  for     falfurrias
howard  the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume
management  s initials in oss  i need some information for daren before it
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the  contract for
   forward

marketing co  as counterparty 
   thru      shows delivery on transport contract        
 esperanza marketing corp as counterparty  
   thru    shows delivery on     
   shows delivery on     
no other transactions at this meter since    
some questions i need answered are  why was volume allocated to transport
contracts through      and then started to be allocated to the 
contract later  are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to
and is that the reason the  contract was used  or should the transport
contract be allocated to instead of the  contract for    forward  each
item indicates a delivered volume  so either a transport or sale is taking
place 
all the information that is supplied on the ua  report is need a contract for
   mmbtu 
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it
was assigned to me  it  s difficult to know why the  contract was ever used
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in
cpr or oss
