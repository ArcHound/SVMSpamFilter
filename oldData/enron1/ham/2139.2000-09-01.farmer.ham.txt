i spoke with brian nichols about the august preliminary invoice  there
appears to be a problem for august     the volumes are much too low 
either there were deliveries off of centana that we are missing  or there is
a problem with the hpl data  i am having brain fade and cannot remember the
name of the person in the measurement department to contact  so maybe you
could look into this and have it corrected 
thanks
