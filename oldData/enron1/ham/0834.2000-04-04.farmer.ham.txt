Subject     saxet 
the above meter is currently doing    on a    nom 
please take a look and see if nom adjustments might be a solution 
looking  deal    the terms indicates that hplc buys     of saxet
volumes  should i assume that i should take the total flow amount  per day
for this deal ticket  and adjust the expected volumes to reflect a nom that
is   of the daily flow versus the    that is currently nomed 
h  e  l  p   
thanks
