Subject cleco deals     state tract   meter  
fred or anita 
i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same
page  from my understanding  the allocation for meter   state tract 
is supplied from bryancy braumley  prior to      bryancy would calculate
flow from certain wellheads  total this volume  and then send us an
allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land
and hpl  sale from cleco  at meter   effective      a compressor was
put in and the gas from  now flows through this compressor  as well as the
gas from meter   deal  sales from dewbre   and is now measured at
meter   tivoli station  for bryancy  s allocation  she must take the meter
statement from meter  and deduct meter   s flow  once this is done 
she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land
and hpl  cleco  like she has done previously  i believe meter  is now a
check meter and meter  is the actual pay meter 
for    there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco  deal 
and   per discussions with daren farmer  danny conner  and jennifer
martinez  i have been instructed to zero out the deal for  and use
 as the correct deal number  therefore  fred boas and i have zeroed
out the  deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal
  deal  was priced at ship less   which was incorrect and deal
 is priced at ship less    therefore  an adjustment will generate
for    for the difference in price and the change in location  the
allocated volume for cleco did not change  however  i am not sure that
bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl
 cleco   i have spoke to her  as well as jennifer martinez  and curtis
funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma  s for volume differences 
in addition  i have changed the allocation method at meter  to be a
callout  swing effect     for october and succeeding months  the volume
should be computed by taking meter  deducting out meter   then
byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land
and hpl  cleco   the texas general land nom is currently at meter  and
the hpl  cleco  deal is at meter   fred mentioned that the texas general
land nom might need to be moved to meter  but nothing has been decided on
that yet 
please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or
you need something more done on my end  also  let me know who is going to be
doing this monthly allocation  it might be beneficial to have one person
doing all the points  meters        thanks for your help
