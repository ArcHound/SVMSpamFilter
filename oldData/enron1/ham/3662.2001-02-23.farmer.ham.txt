subject  wagner  brown  cornelius lease  meter    
per our recent discussions  please evaluate the above gas stream for
reconnection into hpl  this gas is presently being produced into dow
pipeline  an existing  three  inch meter tube is in place  and the gas can be
switched by opening and closing existing valves  a copy of a recent gas
analysis has been provided  the expected gas flow is  to    mcf  d 
mr  matt johnson with wagner hence  enhanced production  i would
attempt to obtain at least a year  s commitment of this gas from wagner 
brown  mr  johnson did not want to flow this gas for march since the
three  inch run could not handle the total volume  and he did not want to
split the flow  operational logistics were also questionable  compression 
etc    if you need further info  please advise  thanks  jab
