subject  hourly gas deals
here is a high level summary of our discussions last week  i believe that
the calculations listed below under option  show how hpl would like to
capture deals and see their postions all based on a  hour flow rate basis 
option  shows what the values would look like under an hourly flow basis 
bob  please review with the other trading directors and see if they also
prefer to see everything on a  hour flow rate basis  thanks   tommy
