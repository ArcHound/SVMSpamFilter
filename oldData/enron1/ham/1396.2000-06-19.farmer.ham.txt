christina 
the attached shows the volumes that should have been nominated effective
     and       the sea robin plant was back up for those two days and
gas was processed resulting in a decrease for pvr  effective       the
plant was down again and volumes were increased to reflect no processing
loss  i forwarded those volumes to you on friday  june  
let me know of any questions you have 
thanks 
steve
