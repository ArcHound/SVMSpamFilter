Subject pg  e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers  i discovered that valero texoma
    bav volumes have not fed into pops since    causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of    mm month to date  the more critical part of
this problem  however  is that pops has fed  volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals  this means that these purchase volumes  expenses  have
not been picked up in tom  s p  l and are  instead  sitting in ua   to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua  value  the p  l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through 
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin  however  a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it  s discovered 
someone needs to be overriding the  volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p  l is kept as accurate as possible 
please give me a call if you have any questions
