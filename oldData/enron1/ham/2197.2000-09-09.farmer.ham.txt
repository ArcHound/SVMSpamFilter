Subject re  equistar buybacks
the only valid  buyback  ticket for meter    is sitara ticket  
  s  ticket    is an old ticket which was used to set up
buyback
ticket across equistar  s meters           if you recall
this process was done to enable client services to automate equistar
allocation  billing  the project took place around april 
production retroactive back to jan    the link to compute the buyback is
set up
on s  ticket   
since equistar has begun doing business via ena  it was necessary to
establish a  buyback ticket  on ena  s matrix 
thus  to answer your question  yes there should only be one  buyback
ticket  for meter    on hpl and ena 
ena activity is kept whole and the swing is on hpl 
i hope i have addressed all of your questions below however  i am
available for follow up discussion if needed 
it has been a pleasure working with you  i learned a lot about the
business while scheduling industrials and thanks for the opportunity

there are three buy back tickets in sitara for equistar at mtr   two for
hpl and one under ena  shouldn  t we have only one buyback for each company
