subject  reliant energy  entex transport imbalance
howard 
this memo is regarding the    mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of  on
transport contract          the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena  originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of   some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
  but    mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract  we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of  we can
clear this imbalance  we will
need to allocated    mmbtu extra to the transport  this will reduce the
purchase from ena by   
mmbtu for that month  i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy  entex allocation to
make sure this happens 
thanks 
michael
