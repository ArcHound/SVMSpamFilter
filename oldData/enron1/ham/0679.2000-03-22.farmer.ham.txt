make the necessary correction  it is correct for    on deal   i

nick  it appears that we paid gmt company  inc   ba   of corpus christi
instead of gmt  inc   ba   of houston  these companies are not
related  we should pay the houston gmt for production at meter    
would you please make the necessary adjustments  thanks

cindy  gmt has advised brian that they have not yet received payment for
production at meter    for the period from      to      
would you look into this and have them paid as promptly as possible  it
appears that the january deal was  and i believe gmt produced   
mmbtu in january

brian  for your information  please note robert  s cautionary warning with
respect to additional wells that gmt may want to drill and add to this
meter  does gmt have additional drilling plans  if so  should we alert them
to the gas quality issue early on

although the gas is non  spec  the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough
that it can be blended okay before reaching beaumont  go for it 
as a precaution  we are starting a trend and i want to be very cautious 
once we connect a well  we can  t go backwards  please be specific with gmt
and limit him to this one well  otherwise he could drill more wells and flow
them all through this new meter
