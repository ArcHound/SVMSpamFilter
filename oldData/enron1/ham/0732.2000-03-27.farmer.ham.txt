subject  re  storage deal  and 
karie  deal number  should be the good deal  deal number  is an
interruptible storage deal and contract  is an interruptible
contract  storage deal  is a firm storage deal  since it doesn  t agree
with the firmness of the contract  i would probably cut off that deal going
forward   tommy
