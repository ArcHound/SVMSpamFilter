sorry it took me so long to get back to you  pg  e did not fully process the
gas stream at their indian springs plant on december  and  and took the
reduced shrinkage     mmbtu  d  and sold it to hpl at gas daily      
pg  e did not have the right to do that  so they are going to allocate that
volume to comstock  from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month
index  at the same time pg  e will create an imbalance  for which they will
pay hpl the same amount hpl paid them for the gas for those two days  this
should wash the sale at gas daily and leave hpl buying the gas at the
beginning of the month ifhsc  the price in the comstock purchase contract 
and selling it at the gas daily price for    and     the paperwork is
on its way to me to close this issue out

sherlyn has brought to my attention the deal i have attached below 
apparently we bot from pge industrial on the  th and  th  pg  e has
allocated an offsetting sale at the meter to teco  and claim that they are
net deals  i do not show a sale in the system at the meter  and i checked
the  k for those days for a corresponding delivery to teco  perhaps at
another meter  and could not find one 
any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated
