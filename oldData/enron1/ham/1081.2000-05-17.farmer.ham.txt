Subject re  cannon interest may  purchase
hi daren 
i received an email from kenny soignet to make sure everything was in the
system for me to pay cannon on friday       
the deal  is   i see that the volume has not been scheduled  so
therefore it is not pulling into unify for me to pay 
are you the person that will be able to schedule the volume in order for me
to pull up this deal 
 i see that in sitara that the deal is set for    production  does that
matter  
thanks  stephanie
