Subject re  sale to shoreline
daren you are correct in that this was only in mops for the  th  it was
edi  d over to pops from the  th through the  st populating all days with
the    nom  the nom was never    out in pops therefore the change
notification process in pops did not pick up a change at this meter  this
meter is pathed by kim and confirmed by me  it is extremely odd that this
was missed in mops  the record would have been out of balance and someone 
if not several people  normally would make a comment on this  also  all
of my records indicate that the    was good through the  st except the
mops entry  my confirmations with koch didn  t reflect the     the last
report i have from koch indicated the    stayed on  there was no record
of a phone call indicating anything other than     it is very odd for
this many checks and balances to fail  also  the volumes were being sent
back to mops which no one caught 
i have spoken with koch today and they agree that the    should have gone
to    therefore i have removed the nom from pops confirmed volumes and
re  allocated the meter  the oba has taken the hit and i am working off the
imbalance now 
daren  i am sorry that you had to look into this when you feel this is my
responsibility  stella was trying to help me out in clearing up errors
because i was buried in current activity  thus the e  mail to you asking for
your help 
if this doesn  t answer all the questions  just give me a call 
thanks

i looked into this deal  we sold this gas for one day only  in mops  the
path was nominated for    only  however  in pops the path was nominated
and confirmed for         this should have been showing up as a
bridgeback error during the month  also  someone should have identified that
the path  nom in mops wasn  t the same as the nom in pops  this discrepancy
should have been found before we closed out january 
i researched this problem by reviewing both systems  looking at the path id
in pops  finding it in mops  and checking the audit on the path in mops  
this type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group 
who has all the necessary tools to find the problem  the resolution  not the
problem  should have been presented to myself or the marketer  with an
explanation of what happened  some one still needs to find out how the gas
was confirmed for the  th   st 
since the gas apparently flowed  we will have to apply the overflow to the
oba  unless you can find a missing transport contract

logistics is waiting to hear from daren on this issue  he will either need
to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place  this
deal  is valid on      only  but the rest of the volume you are
looking for is scheduled on days         i am sure there is no
pricing on those days 
i will let you know as soon as i hear from them
