Subject re  meter  oct   beaumont methanol
i  m sorry  did we discuss bmc    
lee can confirm the accuracy of this  but bmc bought    from us and
intended no swing and no buyback  brandywine  dorcheus  controlled the meter 
therefore it is their responsibility to make up the overs and unders  i
believe a deal is in place with brandywine to cover that very issue for
november  if not please let me know 
lee  if this is not your understanding for nov  business please let us all
know 
thanks

i need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue 
first  you show a deal volume of    on nov   and the pipeline confirmed
this volume  is this the volume you agreed to sell beaumont methanol  this
volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says  the volume confirmed by
hpl  and dorcheus  s volume 
second  the buyback issue is that a buyback is set up until june  per
julie meyers notes she sends out every month  last note sent dec  and you
are on distribution list   brandywine has nothing to do with this issue  it
is an issue between hpl and beaumont methanol 
do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the
buyback 
this is a commercial issue that i need further clarification from you if you
have a buyback in place or not  if not  please notify julie and note on the
deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective 
if it is still active  please contact chyral and resolve 
let me know the final resolution
