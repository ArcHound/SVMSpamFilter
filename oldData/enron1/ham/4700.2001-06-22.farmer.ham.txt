clarissa  thanks so much for all your help with this pipe  everything looks great  i just have a couple of paths
that i need to finish it 
january   i need deal   pathed for epgt and for tetc  according to the invoice  we should have
   dth on the interconnect 
february   i need deal   pathed for hpl and chan  hpl should have    dth and chan should
have    dth on the interconnect 
july   deal   has an interconnect issue  according to mops contract    they received    dth
on the matagorda   but according to epgt  they delivered    dth to hpl    could this possibly
need to be split somehow  or do you have any other ideas
