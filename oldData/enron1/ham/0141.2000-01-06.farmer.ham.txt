i have had several requests from the ena business groups  now that the
agreement has been finalized  for report lists from your key applications 
those
being  altra gms and risk works  there may be others as people become more
aware   there will be a need for information for ena to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period  we feel this would be an easier process to
work
through if ena knows what kind of information they can request as we go
through
the transition
