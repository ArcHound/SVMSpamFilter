Subject tenaska iv   
we need to change the demand fees for tenaska iv based on actuals for jan
  tenaska owes us some additional money  i have attached my netting
spreadsheet if you need it 
deal  change mmbtu from    to   
deal  change amount from         to        
i got your message regarding apache  i will just leave the pay the lesser
ofs there until they come back for it  also  mark checked with txu and we
do not have the rights to get dailies for the tenaska meters  he said that
only the interconnecting pipes get dailies  for the spreadsheet  i am just
going to prorate the actuals based on the noms 
i will let you know when we receive the payment from brazos for feb   so
you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to tenaska iv 
thanks
