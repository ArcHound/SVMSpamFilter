equistar has requested a scheduling  nomination change retroactive to january
 
at the start of the month  janice nominated a small volume to meter  
 or maybe it was to     dupont victoria 
equistar wants that volume to go to meter   instead  for the whole month
of jan 
any questions  call me at   
thanks
