though she  s dead and has just been located  after  years  this lady
continues to haunt us from her shallow grave 
get this 
cbs will be forced to discontinue  touched by an angel  for using the word
god in every program  madeline murray o  hare  an atheist  successfully
managed to eliminate the use of bible reading from public schools a few
years ago  now her organization has been granted a federal hearing on the
same subject by the federal communications commission  fcc  in washington 
dc  their petition  number   would ultimately pave the way to stop the
reading of the gospel our lord and savior  and the airwaves of america 
they got    signatures to back their stand  if this attempt is
successful  all sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by
television will be stopped  this group is also campaigning to remove all
christmas programs and christmas carols from public schools   you as a
christian can help 
we are praying for at least  million signatures  this would defeat their
effort and how that there are many christians alive  well and concerned
about our country  as christians we must unite on this 
please don  t take this lightly  we ignored this lady once and lost prayer in
our school and in offices across the nation 
please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard 
together we
can make a difference in our country while creating an opportunity
for the lost to know the lord 
please press  forward   clean up the message  and forward this to everyone
that you think should read this 
now  please sign your name at the bottom  you can only add your name after
you have pressed the  forward   
don  t delete any other names  just go to the next number and type your name 
please do not sign jointly  such as mr   mrs  each person should sign
his  her own name 
please e  mail this to everyone that you think needs to read this  and help
us defeat this organization and keep the right of our freedom of religion
