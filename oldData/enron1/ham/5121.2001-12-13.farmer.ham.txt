if a deal is killed it poses a problem for us in unify if there are any paths associated with the deal  therefore  we request the deals be zeroed out  call me if this is a problem  also  we would appreciate further details on why these deals are being killed 
in addition  i have copied rita and mark from volume management for their input 
regards 
tammy

we will be killing about  deals in sitara tonight  whenever a deal is touched in sitara  it will bridge over to unify  these are desk  desk deals  and should have minimal impact on you
