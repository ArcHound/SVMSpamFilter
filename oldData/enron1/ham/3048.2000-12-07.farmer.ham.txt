Subject tenaska iv   
we have actuals  the larger of the two volumes is       which is
    day  so the demand rate in deal  is fine  i am having a
problem  though  with the way it is coming to settlements  it is showing up
with a jan  delivery date  i think the demand fee needs to be on   
only  right now  it is on a line with a date of      to       i
think this is confusing the system some how  also  we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv  it should be for a demand fee of        
booked to the cleburne desk  we actually owe          but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables  james
is calling me every day asking for an update  do you know when we will be
able to get this in the system  i have attached my spreadsheet so you can
see the numbers
