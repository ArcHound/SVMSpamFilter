sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue  i am with ees now 
karen lindley allocates this point but i feel the need to help her because
this issue came to light while i was in transition 
exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on
a monthly basis 
december 
the total flow at the meter was  mmbtu  i copied esther garcia on this
e  mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement
error  esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible
measurement error  furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had   
mmbtu confirmed at this point and only  mmbtu flowed  i would ask mark
where he got his confirmed volumes from  as a temporary fix i reallocated
the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources  they will be short
paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement
error issue resolved  i would also suggest that mark and karen get together
to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to
reconcile their allocation with what we have  the additional alpine deal  at
this point  charlene can redraft her invoice on monday      that will
show the  mmbtu going to alpine 
january 
again scheduling has    confirmed at this meter when on    mmbtu
flowed  i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that
flowed went to alpine  they remain  mmbtu short paid but charlene can
redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark  validity of other
deals at this point  and karen  exxon  s allocation of this point  can get
this issue resolved 
there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was
scheduled at    mmbtu per month for the months in question  this
transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 
contract  i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will
take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the
resolution of this issue
