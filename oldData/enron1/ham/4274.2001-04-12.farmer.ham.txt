Subject deal 
meter  recorded flow from march  th to the end of the month  averaging around  per day  the above deal has a zero volume in it  creating an allocation exception at that point  bob is out and this is a gathering point  so do you have any objection with me inserting a deal volume of  per day for that time period 
thanks
