i am having trouble with     the first issue is day  of the purchase at
fuels cotton  we have two deals in sitara  spot deal  and exchange
deal   you had said previously that we would know a spot deal had
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing  since there was a
spot deal  we put all of the volume for day  on deal   duke says that
day  was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at
gd      the exchange deal is currently price at index      please let
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be 
the second issue is the sale volume on deal  for     duke is telling
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the  th  which we see  but that we are
suppose to prorate the gas over the  th   th  and  th for the exchange  this
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the  th and  th and pipeline
shows all of the gas on the  th  this is a daily swing meter which
electronically feeds into settlements  we don  t normally change these
meters  if you intended for us to prorate this gas  i will need your ok  the
emails below are from marta at duke notifying us of the change
