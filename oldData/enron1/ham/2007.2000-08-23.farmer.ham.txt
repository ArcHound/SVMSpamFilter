i am uncomfortable putting a deal out there without more details  here are
my questions 
  why was this gas just discovered now  and where has it been hiding 
  adonis is a wmbe which means he has a direct pay agreement so never pays
for gas taken  we have to invoice
the actual burner for this gas  hl  p  tu  cp  l  etc   can we identify end
user and see if they paid for this gas or will have to pay 
  adonis has skipped town and is no longer in business  hl  p told me he
got paid for gas that never was delivered  rumor  
how can we invoice him now 
     mmbtu seems like a high volume of gas to slip through the cracks
for almost two years  answer the above questions and
i will be glad to approve this

i realize this  it appears as if you  re asking me to have day  added to
the sitara deal ticket so that all volumes that flowed for that day can
allocate to this deal 
maybe you might want to phone me if this is not the case
