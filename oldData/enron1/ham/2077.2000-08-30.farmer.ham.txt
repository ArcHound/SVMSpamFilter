what does mops show for the days in question  it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below  it sounds as if the meter was
allocated incorrectly in pops and  or a deal was not pathed correctly in
mops  let me know what you find in mops

here is the issue for      at meter  
   mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops     mmbtu on day  and
day   day  is not valid for deal   track id    which is where
   was confirmed  the actual sale to adonis was    which was
invoiced and paid by adonis  we are trying to clear the feedback error
report  my question is why was    confirmed on      if the date is
not valid for the deal 
when karen allocates the actual    it is prorating    for each day
that is confirmed  the  th and  th  
should the whole    be allocated to the  th or should    be allocated
to each day  if    should be allocated to each day  the  th needs to be
added to the deal
