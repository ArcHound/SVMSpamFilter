open a window showing a summary of the best price limit order bids and offers
against your managed products  you can click the    sign to the left of a
summary to show a list of all the price limit orders which have been placed
against that product 
under normal circumstances  the price shown on the website will be the same
as the price on your stack manager  however  the system will not allow you to
show a price which is better than an existing price limit order  instead  the
system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing price
limit order while it is being filled  once the appropriate price limit orders
are filled  then the website will again show your stack manager prices 
it is important that you complete the   maximum volume   field in the product
properties window and that you select  allow price limit orders   also  make
sure that the price tick window in the stack manager   s   product properties  
field is appropriate for the product  if you do not do this  your customers
will not be able to use price limit orders for your products
