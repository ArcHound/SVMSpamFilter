brian  this is a pretty good explanation of the case thus far      
commissioner wood is aware of the conflict between pg  e  now epgt  and southern union  probably because of lobbying by southern union  and that is why he raised the issue  southern union states in its initial brief    below  that it opposes the high demand rates that it says epgt proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of order no   and argues that ferc should impose order no   standards on pg  e  i was watching a video stream of the meeting  and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere 
here are the facts in this case 
  on december     pg  e texas pipeline  lp  the predecessor to epgt texas pipeline  lp  filed a petition with ferc for approval of transportation rates under section  along  as they were required to do   all intrastate pipelines that perform section  service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service   pg  e  s filing proposed  in addition to the usual interruptible service  a firm section  service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service  pg  e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services 
  on february     southern union gas company  an intrastate transportation customer of pg  e  filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing  pg  e opposed the late intervention  but ferc granted it on april      pg  e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service  
  southern union submitted data requests to pg  e on april  and april   pg  e attempted to get a protective order issued  but ferc rejected their request 
  a settlement conference was held on september    
  a staff panel was convened on october     in order to conduct an advisory  non  evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues  with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within  days 
  on november     ferc requested  pages of additional information from pg  e in order to complete the application in the proceeding  which pg  e provided on november  th  on december  th  pg  e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request 
  on january     southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg  e 
  on january   el paso field services informed ferc that pg  e texas pipeline  lp had been acquired by el paso on december     and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline  lp 
  on january     epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs 
  on july     epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below  where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no   and  provisions to section  service providers  epgt stated that  if ferc proceeds with this policy  it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding  on july     southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt  s supplemental comments 
  on august   epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions  which provides for electronic nominations  two additional nomination cycles  bumping  clarified and updated credit provisions  modified quality provisions to protect system integrity  and more clearly defined authorized overrun service 
the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section  service and requires that such service be provided on a non  discriminatory basis  but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require  for example  compliance with order nos   and  
please let me know if this is enough detail  or maybe it  s more than you wanted
