conversation a week or two ago  hpl needs to take the swing to keep the other
contracts whole  in the case where we have excess flow the hpl  r  contract
takes the swing  so in the case where we are short  shouldn  t we have a hpl
 d  contract to take the swing  please let me know if this will work  i
need to get back with settlement today  thanks
