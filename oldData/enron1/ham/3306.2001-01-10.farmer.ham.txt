subject  kcs buy  sell
in light of december  s allocation of actual volumes at kcs    it looks as
though we need to reduce the nom at both this meter and at tejas riverside 
   where the  sell  portion of this buy  sell occurs for the remainder of
january  december actual receipts at   were    mm or an average of
 mm  day  the january nomination is  mm  day  i think it needs to be
reduced to approx  mm  day effective    or there may be a large diffence
between what we buy at the wellhead and what is delivered back to kcs at
tejas riverside  any info you could get from gas control or kcs about actual
flow current month would help nail this nomination down  thanks
