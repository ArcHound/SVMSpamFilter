i  m not sure what  s going on  but i did not see a teco deal ticket in mops
for houston pipeline company anywhere  january  to march    i did
see one on houston pipeline company resources 
as my original note stated  i think this is a buy  sell which means that teco
gas processing should appear in both the market and supply depending on
hplc  s position 
please let me know something asap

contract covering meters  and   this contract was obtained in
connection with the seven oaks  turpentine lease line renewal  and it doesn  t
appear to have hit the system  please ensure that the contract is set up and
filed
