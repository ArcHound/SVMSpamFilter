subject  hpl meter   south katy gas unit no    
daren 
during the month of september and october   gas flowed into hpl  s
pipeline at the above meter that is owned by duke energy trading and
marketing  llc  prior to september   the gas was purchased under
contract    and deal   that expired on       effective
      the gas was again purchased from duke under contract   
deal    but this deal expires on      
currently  logistic has september and october  volumes recorded to hpl
strangers gas contract  in order to correct this  hpl logistics needs either
   deals   or   extended to cover september and october  
   a new deal to cover september and october   or    logistics needs
approval to write  off these volumes to unaccounted for gas loss   print 
sign  and return the original to clem cernosek  
deal  deal ticket   customer  buyer  seller 
or
approval to write  off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
in addition  since deal   expires on      and gas is still
flowing  logistics needs either    deal   extended  or    a new deal
to cover december  and any other future months that this production is
flowing into hpl  s pipeline 
            
new deal 
thanks  clem
