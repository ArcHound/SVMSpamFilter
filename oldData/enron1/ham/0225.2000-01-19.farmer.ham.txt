subject  carthage plant imbalance
i  ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
 carthage plant operator  and willie shannon at devon energy and here is what
i  ve learned  duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance  which
according to devon was approximately    due to duke at       devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn  t think it was that high 
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong  according to duke the imbalance grew by    in september    
in
october  and another    in november  all round numbers  bringing the total
to approximately    through the end of november  based on current month
estimates  duke thinks january sales are         day higher than
production  and would like to see a cut in sales of     day effective friday
     in order to balance for the month of january  again devon disagrees
with this daily overage  based on their production estimates  but since they
recognize an imbalance exists  willie  devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by     day effective friday the  st  this will reduce
the amount of  excess  gas  gas daily  priced  that enron has available to sell
at carthage 
additionally  beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
    day  continuing until the imbalance is worked off  devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by     d to accomplish this  and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity 
a key point to this imbalance issue  and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on  is that ces  now enron  purchases devon  s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant  so any production  related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant  duke  and make  up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon  enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance  however  since ces  and now enron  is set up as
devon  s agent at carthage  duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make  up arrangements with enron  enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make  up  hopefully once actual make  up commences  devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on 
please call me if you have any questions
