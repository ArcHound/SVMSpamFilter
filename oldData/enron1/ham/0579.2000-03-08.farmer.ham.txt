 i hear from midcon this afternoon via voice mail  i understand that they
 were not to happy that they had relief values blowing out being that they
 were coming in with a fixed baseload of  for today  and lcr had not
 notified that our present requirement couldn  t handle that much  i
 understand from utilities this afternoon that the baseload with midcon was
 cut due to lcr  s limited requirements  i was also notified this evening
 that the planned maintenance on hpl has been extended through tomorrow
 with midcon again scheduled to come in with the  baseload 

 thanks
