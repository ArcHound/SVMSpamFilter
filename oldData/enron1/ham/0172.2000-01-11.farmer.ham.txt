i wanted to make sure everyone had plenty of advance notice  i would like
each of you to review these times with your staff  the production release is
the largest to date and the time required to convert the data cannot be
shortened any more  production users will not be impacted by the lack of the
parallel environment  we will continue to bridge deal updates to unify
parallel as we do now for the period stated above  however access to sitara
