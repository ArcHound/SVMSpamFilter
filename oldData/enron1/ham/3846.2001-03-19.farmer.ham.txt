per conversation with rosa brown and thu  in volumes management  beaumont methanol is a swing deal  by which the gas sales allocations are handled by the scheduletr  thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter   
do you still handle the sales allocations for hpl meter    if so  can you confirm    sales  on hpl  meter     sales deal     to beaumont methanol  which we  ve invoiced them   vs  chyral hankins  e  mial to buddy majorwitz below  the only date that is really in question is sales for flow date       she reflects noms of  vs  the    mmbtu that we invoiced them  
thanks
