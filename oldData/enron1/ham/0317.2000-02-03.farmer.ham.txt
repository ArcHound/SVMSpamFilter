subject  bridgeback error at meter  for   
aimee 
there is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month  the
reason for the error is that the deal    has expired  please determine
if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it 
to fix this i will set up an accounting arrangement but what i need from you
is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to
put the deal on 
thanks in advance for your help
