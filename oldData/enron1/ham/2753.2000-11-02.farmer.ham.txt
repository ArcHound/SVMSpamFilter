is this date really june of   hopefully we  re not just finding out about
this 
i don  t think we can even process this request  the east desk was not up and
running on unify in june of   all of our pathing for june of  was in
autonoms and it  s not y  k compatabile  with the volumes involved being so
small and the accuracy of the data at enerfin in question  why don  t we let
this volume hit the new oba at enerfin as a ppa   
i welcome your thoughts

on the above mentioned dates  there was no nomination at the enerfin meter 
     and      revealed activity for ena   k   can the deal be extended
for      dec   and      dec   to cover this flow so that volume
management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days 
thanks
