subject  tejas deliveries at oasis katy
on tuesday  march  th  tejas took gas from us at oasis katy and gave it back
to us at tejas laporte to help us out during an outage for     mmbtu  this
transaction has not been scheduled correctly  there are two deal tickets in
sitara to cover the oasis portion of the deal    covers ena selling
the gas to hplc for hplc to transport on tejas  deal   covers the
transport usage on tejas from oasis katy to laporte  i have edited this
ticket to add the     mm charge  there needs to be a tejas expense contract
at laporte     to cover the approx     mm received there on the  th 
these volumes are currently sitting on the laporte oba 
jackie  if you would work with carlos he should be able to walk you through
getting this scheduled correctly in all systems
