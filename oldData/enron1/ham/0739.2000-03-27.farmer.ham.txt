gary  mainline valves to be closed on the    line are as follows 
u   at crown street and u   at the end of the line where ship channel loop
 line ties into the shell west  line 
it is my understanding that the following customers within this outage
section currently take gas 
air products meter 
albemarle meter 
the current schedule would call for an outage to start on      and be back
in service on

the pipeline outage time mentioned in the memo below needs to be revised 
actual construction time should be  days and pipeline outage time should be
 days max  this outage time  which is longer than the norm  is due to the
fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same
ditch before tie ins take place 
as an update  the first train is now scheduled to cross late today  they now
say that it may take  weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are
able to begin replacing our line 
              
i have been advised by the deer park rr representative  dean truitt  that
the rail cars will begin arriving on      
per our conversations today  please have someone on tuesday    adjust the
regulators at simpson and at shell deer park so that  psig is the maximum
pressure in that pipeline section 
i will maintain contact with deer park on the duration of this project and
keep you informed  it is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction
will be on the order of  weeks 
after the initial  rail cars have entered and exited their facility  deer
park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline
replacement at that location  this replacement would involve an outage on
this segment of pipeline for approximately  days  i would anticipate that
this outage would occur in early april 
thanks for your cooperation in this matter
