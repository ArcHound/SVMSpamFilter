here is my problem  as you know  hplc did a deal with texas general land office where we would exchange gas for crude  the problem was hplc was selling the gas and enron gas marketing was receiving the crude  bryce baxter worked out a series of intercompany deals between hplc  ena and egm that would book the deal correctly  julie meyers was told how to create the deals and she completed january and february  except for one small part  but march forward was never completed  the attached word document explains the procedure  basically  we were suppose to book an hplc sale to the tglo with volume and zero price  this would book the volume to the gl and zero out the receivable since we were never going to receive cash from tglo  then  we would book a sale from hplc  wellhead to ena  wellhead for the value of the gas only  no volume  and a sale from ena  wellhead to egm for the value of the crude  no volume   for these deals  we would use demand fees  egm will pay ena for the crude dollars 
i will give you the deals for january so you can see how the dollars move  you will see that the price is still on the sale from hplc to tglo  julie zeroed this out  but o  neal put it back  i  ve left him a message to find out why
