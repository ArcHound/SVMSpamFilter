Subject re  hpl discrepancy
rita  please help me with this  i have some questions regarding enerfin 
why are we re  allocating prior month volumes at enerfin after we matched your
original numbers back in october  can  t this be fixed in the actualization
process 
the numbers for october between ena  tetco and hpl vary a good bit  are we
your only customer at that point and why do we show volumes on days ena had
no transactions with hpl  can we simply put zero paths in unify and extend
our existing deals in sitara with zero volumes and have you guys actualize
these small volumes to handle this  we go round and round at this point
changing volumes two  three or more times  call me if you have questions  
thanks victor

subject  re  hpl discrepancy
victor 
the sitara ticket that we were using for the month of october is   
tetco shows that the volumes that hpl was allocated on october  th and
october  th  were  dths and  dths  respectively  those volumes were
pulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in
place  this is the same problem that we have had over and over with them 
also  we just found out on tuesday  that the oba did not go into effect until
december     we were originally told that they were putting the oba in
effect retroactively to november of   in fact  i thought that hpl had
made a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the oba  do you
remember that  hpl told us that ray calles at tetco is the one who decided
that the oba would not be effective until december of   nobody even
informed us of this change  i stumbled upon it when researching a november
issue for alfonso trabulsi and brenda fletcher  in addition to all of this 
i received another email  which i will copy below  asking me to go in for the
month of october and adjust all of my estimated volumes in unify to match
what hpl shows that we were allocated  i had been going in all month long
and matching to their numbers  and we were clean for the deadline at the end
of the month  i ran the allocation report from tetco for the month of
october  and some of hpl  s numbers were very different from tetco  s 
including the two days that i mentioned above  i sent jackie young an email
back showing her tetco  s numbers and i haven  t received a response  i will
copy that email below as well  just to catch you up on what  s been going on

subject  october volumes
hi jackie 
i ran a report from tetco  s system to show the volumes that enron was
allocated for the month of october  and some of the volumes are very
different from the volumes that you show  i copied your numbers below and
copied tetco  s volumes below that  with the disrepancies in red   i was
wondering if you could double check the  rd   th   th   th   th  and  th
to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than
enron north america at that meter  it looks like maybe the volumes that you
show are the total flow at that meter  but i think that only part of the gas
was actually allocated to us  i don  t mind putting the allocated volumes in
path manager  but i  d like to make sure that on the above days  i am only
putting in the amount that enron was allocated 
also  on the  th and the  th tetco shows exactly half of what you show 
which i thought was kind of strange  i am going to have to get tetco  s
permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes
you have requested  before i can put anything in sitara or unify  my manager
is out of the office and will be back tomorrow  but i would like for him to
double check the deal that we will have to create in sitara for those two
days  since we are dealing with a prior month issue
