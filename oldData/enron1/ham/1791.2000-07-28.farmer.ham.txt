in regards to meter    the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me 
to your questions 
  cannot determine who owns this meter  i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns 
  hpl has a fifty    ft  easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the   
  i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located 
hope this helps

attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction 
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists 
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter    to install an h  s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht   well 
once the h  s monitor has been installed and the albrecht   well is ready to
flow  we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht   well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc  the albrecht   will not be
covered by   nor will the wells currently subject to  be
subject to the spot gtc 
coastal will reimburse hplc     for the cost of the installation

we intend to attempt to connect about    mmbtu  d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may    the meter flowed about 
mmbtu  d of     co  gas 
the content of the albrecht   gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht   h  s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing  mmbtu  d behind
meter     the miller  albrecht unit    a and the hoff heller gas unit
  a    d  coastal further purports that for some time now it  and  or its
predecessor  mjg  corp   has treated these three wells for h  s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h  s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels  coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h  s
content of the albrecht   to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc  in your opinion  should coastal be forced to install an h  s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc
