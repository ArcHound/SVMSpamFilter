when i look back in cpr for the delivery periods of        on cpr pipeline exchange  i do not see anything being flashed as an imbalance  i  e  the buys and sales always equal in cpr  however  we are booking an imbalance every month on the parking and lending contract  should there be something in cpr for these volumes  let me know because it is causing an oa variance for us  thanks
