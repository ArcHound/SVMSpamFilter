Subject winter cap for entex
when you get allocations for january  we need to look at daily volumes for
transaction    towards the end of the month  entex was approaching its jan
winter cap volume of     day  if the daily volume for trans   comes out
greater than   the excess must be charged at gd    the numbers thus far
show that they did not exceed   however  the allocated volumes tend to
differ
