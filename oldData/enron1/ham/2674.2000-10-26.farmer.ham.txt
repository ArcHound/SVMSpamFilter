Subject spinaker  n  padre island block   allocations
per our various discussions  i am sending an email to reiterate the
disposition of volumes at meter   the lehman spinaker pay meter  at this
time  the general land office is transporting their share of production
     interest  and hpl is purchasing the remaining     
the glo has nominated a transport volume at meter   effective september
    during this time  some test gas flowed  i have had the hpl
purchase back  dated to coincide with the transport nomination  and have had
both deals moved to   the meter should probably be designated a
callout  swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after
the production month by volume management 
for october production forward  i am going to re  rank  confirm the pay meter
to ensure that the glo receives a volume which should be close to their
percentage after actuals close for the month  this should alleviate any
large balance swings on their agreement 
anita  for september  i need an accounting arrangement on deal ticket
  hpl gathering agmt  at meter   please unallocate the transport
and purchase at   the meter is a daily swing right now  let me know
when you are ready and i will change the allocation methodology 
i apologize for the length of this email  i want to make sure that we are all
on the same page  to the extent that we need to be  prior to this deal
getting too far down the road  please do not hesitate to call me if you have
any questions  comments  concerns  etc  i am at extension  
thank you all for your time and patience
