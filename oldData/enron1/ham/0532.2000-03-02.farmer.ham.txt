Subject feb  intercompany accrual variances
below is a list of sitara deals that had volume variances or where one side
 purchase  sale  did not get accrued for the feb  accrual  my goal
here is to bring this to everyone attention and second to see if there is a
solution  i am taking a simplistic approach here in that since
intercompany sitara deals are the same that the nominations on both sides
should match on the month end accruals  if i am wrong on this assumption
or if there is a system limitation i am free to suggestions  ideas or
resolutions  please feel free to give me a call
