Subject hgpl and kgpl   rivers gas
based on the conversation we had at the meeting last thursday  i am
implementing the following changes to humble gas pipeline and king ranch gas
plant  if you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the
items below  please be sure to call me asap 
  input hplc purchase from hplr liquids at meter   hpl  hgpl   remove
the  rivers gas from the interconnect ticket and input on
the purchase deal 
  input hplc sale to hplr liquids at meters   kgpl  hpl  and 
 kgpl  hgpl   remove  rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets
at these meters and input on the sales deals appropriately 
  change swing parameters for the king ranch contracts to swing on cage
ranch before swinging on  rivers gas  this will hopefully allow
the sale for  rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible 
i will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day  and
have all contracts repathed  it is my understanding that we are implementing
these changes effective feb  lst 
stella  this may or may not effect repathing of the hplc gas at meter  
based on the swing parameters that you have been using 
thank you
