i plan to be on vacation july     finally  and on the customer trip on the
 th  while i am out  gary hanks will be keeping our position during
trading  stacey will be in charge of everything else  i am comfortable that
everything will be covered 
i will be back in town thursday night  the primary flight for the customer
trip leaves around     others leave at    and        the latest
idea we had is that pat would take a later flight on this trip and i will
take a later flight on the august trip  allowing one of us to be in the
office for half the day  i can also come in for the half day on the  th if
we decide that is needed
