i show that you extended the purchase  deal ticket   to cover flow on
the first two days  however  now that measurement has closed  i show that we
have flow on this meter for the entire month  with the exception of a few
days in the middle  please let me know if we want to extend this deal   
of hsc  lg  etc  or if i should put this gas on strangers until we determine
what to do  i am now on the dreaded ua  list from vol  mgmt
