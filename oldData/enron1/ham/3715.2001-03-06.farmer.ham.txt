Subject re  revised  tenaska iv  cleburne plant
daren 
we are working with mark mccoy on getting some things repathed in the
system  it appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in unify
just the deliveries  not sure why      we have been paying the suppliers
based on whatever they invoice us for  which typically has been a smaller
number than what we have in unify  also  we have not been able to get a
contact for the allocation statement  in some cases  we get the summary
sheet  but no detail and some months we don  t get anything at all  do you
know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on
a timely and consistent basis  the contacts on the allocation statements
that we do have are not returning phone calls  i also need to know what was
the beginning balance when we took this on for tenaska  anything else that
we need from you  i will call you 
thanks
