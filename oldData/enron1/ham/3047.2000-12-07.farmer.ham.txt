subject  spinnaker  supply verification  su  october  production
gary 
when spinnaker got paid  the volumes inadvertently got averaged over the
month  since spinnaker was paid gas
daily pricing for the month  there is going to be a dollar discrepancy when
the volumes are re  sent over on the actual
day of flow  in my calculations  using gas daily less    as the price  we
are going to owe spinnaker an additional
      
one issue that needs to be addressed is this  should the additional money go
directly to spinnaker since they are allocating
out october  production payments to ranger and houston exploration 
attached is a spreadsheet showing where i came up with the extra money owed 
thank you all  
christy

ps this does not address the issue between the onshore and offshore meter 
this is just addressing the redistribution
of volumes for the month of october
