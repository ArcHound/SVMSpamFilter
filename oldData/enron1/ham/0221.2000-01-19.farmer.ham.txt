Subject  plan allocations and january allocations
please read brian  s memo below  we spoke briefly about this yesterday in the
staff meeting  i have copied each of you on a memo earlier today where i
have provide the  plan allocations  please note that we were not making
changes to the plan  only breaking the gas asset group into smaller buckets 
any chnages which have been made since the budget was approved are not
reflected on the allocation sheet  rather they are reflected on the   
allocations  and they will require explanations each month as all variances
from plan do  this includes new rc  s which have set up  etc 
i need each of you to review the  plan allocations as i submitted them
earlier today  and provide an accurate allocation of your rc for     what
has your group spent their time on in       please be aware that we could
receive questions from the commercial teams  so document your logic  some
things to consider 
project sally  allocate to gas network development
project hurricane  allocate to       i have a call into jim coffey 
denver business  allocate to rocky mountain asset originations
if you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them 
either call me  jackie nelson or jim coffey 
one other thing to note  the network trading group will be further broken
down into  groups  trading  tom martin and jim schwieger  and
transportation  ed gottlob   although the attached worksheet does not
include this breakdown  please include it in yours

subject   plan allocations and january allocations
the attached files contain the allocation percentages for  plan  january
 actuals and a description of the new assets teams 
please update the  plan file to reflect the following changes to the
assets team  the assets team is now broken out into the following  groups 
which are described in the attached word document 
rc  team name rc owner
the  plan file now has columns for the above teams  please take the
percentage that was previously allocatated to assets  which is in the
executive column  and reallocate it among all of the teams except rocky
mountain asset originations that you support  i have already inserted the
new percentages to be used for rocky mountain  which are based on a portion
of the upstream origination allocation that was determined by the assets
group  consequently i have changed the allocation percentage for upstream
origination  i have also protected all of the cells except the ones you need
to change to avoid confusion 
i also need you to update the percentages to be used for january 
actuals  i have added the new rc  s that we have set up since plan has been
complete  so please make sure you have each rc   allocated 
i will need the updated plan percentages returned to me by noon wednesday
january  th  and the updated january  percentages returned to me by end
of day friday january  st 
thanks for your help in getting these updated
