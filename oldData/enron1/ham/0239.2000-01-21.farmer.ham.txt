Subject meter   brandywine  dupont and beamont methanol
my contact at beaumont methanol asked me to tell everybody in our shop the
following  to clarify whom to contact about the nomination and scheduling
for beaumont methanol at meter   
first some background  we feed beaumont methanol through a meter station
that we own and control  but which also feeds brandywine  dupont  in fact 
the gas goes through a dupont pipeline header downstream of our meter station
before it gets to beamont methanol  sometimes we are doing business with
both beaumont methanol and brandywine  dupont      but sometime we only do
business with one of them 
whom to call for any nominations and scheduling issues for beaumont methanol 
bob dorcheus  brandywine  dupont      
chyral hankins  beaumont methanol  terra       
please do not call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant with
regard to scheduling and nomination issues  they are out of the loop on
these issues  if we call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant
with regard to scheduling and nominations issues  it will cause confusion of
the type we had yesterday and today 
obviously  it is of course ok for hpl gas control to call the beaumont
methanol plant control room on any emergency operational issues 
thanks    and have a great weekend
