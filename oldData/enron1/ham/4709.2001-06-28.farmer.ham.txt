folks 
you  ve probably already read that listbot is dying as of august  
so  i  ve created a transition list on another service  to send messages to
the list  please start using the following e  mail address 
brcc  yf  topica  com
i plan on closing the old list   listbot  com  as of
friday  august  
if you are still interested in participating in the  bammel young families 
list  please send an e  mail to  brcc  yf  subscribe  topica  com  
if you think you  ll want to check the past messages  or to create your own
lists in the future  use the following steps 
  go to http    www  topica  com  lists  brcc  yf
  on the right hand side of the page  type in your e  mail address under
 not a topica member yet 
  click  continue 
  fill in the registration  then click the  i agree  button
  you  ll next see a page with text like  thanks  ram  you  re almost done  
  scroll to the end of this page  and click the  continue  button 
  a dialog will pop  up  asking whether you want to  tap into exclusive   
blah  blah  blah   just click cancel 
once you join the new list  please drop me an e  mail to
 rtackett  abacustech  net   i  ll then delete you from the old so that you
won  t get duplicate messages from both lists 
the messages on the new list will be available to members online at 
http    www  topica  com  lists  brcc  yf
one nice feature of topica is the ability to put messages on  vacation
hold   so that we don  t end up with auto  responder problems  for more info
on  vacation hold   go to http    topica  com   and then click on the
 vacation hold  link under  subscriber services  
thanks
