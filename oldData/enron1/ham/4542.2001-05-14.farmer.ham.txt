Subject opportunity on dow pipeline
darren  per our earlier conversation  here are the facts related to the opportunity to service a plant in the freeport area off of dow 
the potential customer  don owen  has supplied this plant for the past  years  buying supply from dow 
dow does not want to be a supplier in the future  but of course  will transport 
dow will quote only a  year transport      from katy to the plant   but the customer wants a minimum of  years 
other bids he is getting at index       less whatever transport 
the swing load is approx     mmbtu  d  but fairly steady he says 
let me know if you have any interest or if i should pass this along to someone else  thanks 
ps the customer will give more info if we are interested  but wanted to see if we have interest first  and also if we had long term capacity on dow
