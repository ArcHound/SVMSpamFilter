here goes   
  i know tennessee  hpl  and tejas are at the tailgate of the plant  and i
suspect midcon texas is there as well 
  i  ll fax you a copy of the nomination form that steve locke uses for agua
dulce and carthage    those are the only ones in texas that we nominate 
  the tejas plant as well as all of the other gulf energy receipt points
from
pennzenergy are exclusively tejas  gulf energy points  and it takes transport
charges to move the gas through gulf energy to interconnects  such as
thompsonville  the jennings plant does have a split connect with delhi  but
operationally pennzenergy much prefers to flow into gulf energy  lower
pressure
 higher volumes  
  mustang island  for january is again    mmbtu  d  which peoples will
pick up at the wellhead  mustang island  is     d  which leaves     d
available to sell assuming we continue to transport     d to fgt  tivoli for
peoples  our it agreement on nng is   to move gas from the wellhead to
onshore 
  the tomcat gas has been sold to entex into midcon texas for so long that i
don  t think maria even talks to them anymore each month  tammi provides them
with the volume when she does the deal each month  but we can certainly
provide an entex contact if the gas is sold to them again in january 
  there isn  t a waskom nomination form  the trader for this gas  mike
landolt  talks to ben britten  president of new waskom gas gathering and
waskom
gas marketing  
  you must be referring to the page of offshore avails that begins with
sabine pass   the  columns that appear blacked out read as follows  pvr 
pvr  avail  dbq  dbq  and remainder

subject  re  more questions
  at carthage  the deliveries to koch  what is that  on your
whiteboard for  who is it to  are the volumes termed up 
  at midcon texas  you usually sell all the supply to its marketing
affiliate  correct  is so  is that gas termed up or do you sell it month to
month 
  is the gas to entex off tomcat sold as base or swing  don  t they change
the volume occasionally  has anadarko given you any avails for jan 
round  
  the     carthage for koch is an estimate of what we anticipate we
will
want to sell into koch    and it shows up on the koch whiteboard as a supply
 from carthage   during bidweek the traders will decide how much they
actually
want to show going to koch  and how much will be labeled base and swing  mike
landolt has been our sole koch trader and he typically takes some carthage gas
into koch  but i wouldn  t say a particular volume is termed  up 
  other than very rarely shippling the jennings ranch volume over to ngpl 
we  ve always sold all of the midcon texas volumes to the affiliate   
currently done one month at a time  john hymel has been the trader for these
volumes 
  the entex sale  tomcat has always been gas daily because that is the way
kerr  mcgee prices the supply    and entex has taken all the swings  the
january volume is     d
