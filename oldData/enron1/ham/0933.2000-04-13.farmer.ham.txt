Subject re  brandywine meter     march   activity
just to set the record straight  measurement was not contacted nor informed
that the recorded flow was inaccurate  we are dependent on the field to
verify measurement information  and absent information to the contrary  the
recorded volumes were published  the hms technician  charlie speigel  was
contacted today  and this issue was discussed and verified that he
neglected to notify gms of the erroneous recorded flow  we will correct the
statements to reflect zero flow based on this discussion

there was no flow at meter  for the month of march  the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again  i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this 
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open  gas control  s
understanding and the field  s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place  if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve 
robert 
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved 
thanks
