effective       hplc amended its contract with royal production changing the price to   hsc less     and extending the term through       consequently  for march  hplc should be purhasing volumes from two wells at meter   effective april  hplc amended the same contract releasing the l  g  talbert   lease in the committed reserves agreement  mike morris is the gas buyer and expects volumes of approximately  mmbtu  d  for april i nom   d  bob  we should probably increase the nom to reflect the incremental production at this point 
thanks

louis cox with copano  the interconnecting party at this meter  informed me that effective march lst  we should have been buying incremental gas from royal production at this point since they were no longer selling it to copano  there have been no changes in the producer services noms at this point  however  this point appears to be on a  day chart and the last flow i have access to shows noms of  mm with bav of  mm on march  th  bob  vance  could one of you guys check into this and see what the nom should be  copano says they  re not getting the gas in april either  but they do not know how long hplc is purchasing the incremental gas from royal  please let me know what the resolution is  thanks
