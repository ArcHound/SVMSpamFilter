Subject eol killed deals
over the past several weeks  we have seen an increase in the number of
 killed  or modified eol transactions  please remind each of your
respective groups that this is not an option  once a customer  clicks  on a
deal  we have a valid  binding contract  we lose our audit trail  and we
can potentially expose ourselves from a legal standpoint  i talked to mark
taylor about this today  and the best option is for legal to prepare a
termination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal  we
 product control  should be notified immediately if someone is requesting to
change an eol deal  you can call either myself  jennifer denny  x   
frank davis  x    or dale neuner    
call me if you have any questions
