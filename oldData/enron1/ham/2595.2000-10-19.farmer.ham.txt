subject  gorons
don  t know who you  re voting for  but here some things you might want to
consider 
what is a goron
  gorons sincerely believe that vice president gore is a true
environmentalist  when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm 
a polluting zinc mine  from which he received     of income last
year 
  gorons likewise believe that the vp is antismoking and anti  tobacco
when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies 
  gorons truly believe that gore is a vietnam war hero  when in fact
he was placed by family influence in a  cushy  correspondent  s job and
the only action he saw was that of his brownie camera   and his bong 
  gorons actually believe that mr  gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the office of the vp  simply because the
vanderbilt law educated vp claims he was ignorant of the illegality 
  gorons further believe that it was ok for al to accept large sums
of political money from china through buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty  since he again claimed ignorance 
  gorons also believe that the man who claimed to  invent the
internet  would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially incriminating e  mail 
  gorons  incredibly  believe gore  s claim that he and tipper were
the models for the book and movie   love story  even though the book  s
author  erich segal  says not 
  gorons  amazingly  believe that gore will be the consumer  s
champion against high gasoline prices although gore holds a million
dollars in occidental petroleum stock 
  gorons applaud mr  lieberman  s open rejection of president
clinton  s immorality  but believe it was fine for mr  gore to remain
silent on the subject  while simultaneously declaring mr  clinton  one of
the greatest presidents of our history  
  gorons believe that al gore is an effective leader  when they
won  t bother to look at his record as a tennessee senator  a record so
ineffective that it has led to the election of republicans as both of
tennessee  s senators 
  gorons hold the belief that gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man  s friend  in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum house that he was renting to them 
cautionary note  medical researchers acknowledge that gorons are
generally harmless  except when allowed into a voting booth  there 
unfortunately  overcome by their gullibility syndrome  they are apt to
actually vote for gore  they should be carefully protected from their
ailment  since it may be harmful to their well  being  yours  mine and
that of the usa 
therefore  please  heed the surgeon general  s warning  reach out to
aid the gorons in overcoming the syndrome  and  please  pass this on to
your normal friends  who might also know gorons who need immediate
treatment
