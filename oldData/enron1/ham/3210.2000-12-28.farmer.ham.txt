Subject re  richardson volumes nov  and dec  meter 
nick 
i am not sure what happened to this volume  i cannot tell by the audit
trail  but there is a connection between meter hpl meter   and midt
  the volume you are referring to is on mid  tex pipeline under meter
  it it pathed as a point to point nom with no deal reference  i do
not think this is correct because the deal you reference show hplc as
purchaser  the volume is in mips under meter   but the supply deal
is set up on hpl meter   and the audit trail in sitara shows the deal
was moved from midt to hpl  get with thu when she returns to see if she
knows anything about this
