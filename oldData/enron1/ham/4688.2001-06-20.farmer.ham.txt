 the contract    should have expired under ena  but because of
 the timing of the expiration  it got  assigned  to aep  hpl    
 therefore  for informational  historical purposes  i extended the term
 under  thru      

 someone from linda  s group will have to extend the term under the
 original contract in order for the deal to be attached
