instead of going to the haunted house  we decided to do something where
everyone could be involved  the weather is going to nice and cool  so the
plan is to have a fire  eat and then play  capture the flag   we will
divide into two teams and then each team hides their opponents flag
somewhere on their side  the goal of the game is to find your team  s flag
and bring it safely back to your side  of course  it will be dark and you
have to be sneaky  because if you get caught on your opponent  s side  then
you have to wait until you are freed  it is a very fun game  but even more
entertaining will be to see different sides of people  s personalities  if
you aren  t up to playing the game  then please feel free to hang out around
the fire and just yack for hours
