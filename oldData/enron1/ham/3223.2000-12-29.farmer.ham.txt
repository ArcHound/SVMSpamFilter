subject  tenaska iv gas
daren  per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and
williams  apache and our understanding of the agency agreement  i had a few
items i wanted to discuss with you  in lieu of our meeting today that was
cancelled  
  looking at the october gas supply to the plant  i think tenaska iv should
have been charged at the contract prices with williams  apache  i  e     
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan  s summary 
   at        price of      if this volume was charged at
   the total would have been        a difference of       
  looking at the november gas supply to the plant  tenaska iv was charged
    per mmbtu  instead of     for volumes of     at the    
price  the total settlement price was     instead of       at
    showing a difference of       
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price  pg    for
 gas is     which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment
if delivered at waha  this adjustment started in  at    per mmbtu and
increase by   per year  thereby currently  the adjustment factor is at
   giving us a price of     per mmbtu 
in reviewing the apache gas agreement  pg     i noticed that the gas price
is    at waha     at katy  carthage for   per review of the apache
invoices  it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at
other places  i  e  lomak  sterling  mendell cdp  at a price of      if
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a
margin difference then that is upside to enron  however  i think the plant
should not be charged above the contract price of     
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and
october  i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from
williams and apache of    mmbtu per day  therefore i don  t think spot
prices are part of the equation here  additionally  i recall from our
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of
   per mmbtu  excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas
delivery points if my scenario above is correct  
so based upon items    above  i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price
differences showed above  therefore  i am planning to wire a payment of
       see breakout below  on friday      to enron on behalf of
tenaska iv texas partners  ltd  for this activity 
month plant gas price amount
november          
november adjustment        
october adjustment        
nov  agency fee           
sept  agency fee           
total      
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita  rick hill  jody pierce before
reaching this conclusion  should you have any different ideas or thoughts
that i am not covering  please call me at    and we can discuss  thanks 
james
