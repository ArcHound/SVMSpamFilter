clarissa 
per our conversation last week  we are unable to increase ec   sp  and
wc     due to the tennessee seal on the  leg  this shall confirm the
volumes will remain at first of the month levels until the seal is lifted 
at that time  i will recalculate the changes and notify you of any changes at
that time 
thanks 
steve
