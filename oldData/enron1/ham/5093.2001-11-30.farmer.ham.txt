it looks like we will be making our bammel true  up payment to aep in the next couple of days  included in the payment to aep is a deduction for the sale of the centana storage gas  we are selling them      mmbtu      for a total of          the sale is for september   production  we will need a deal put in sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics  however  there is only      mmbtu on report  in unify  for contracts     and    how do we account for this volumetic difference  connie will be truing up the gl to match the current unify volume  the gl was short approx     mmbtu because a beginning balance was not booked 
this needs to happen before the upcoming close 
thanks for you help in this matter 
please let me know of any concerns
