the swift deal is not pathed correctly in pops  i set up an accounting
arrangement on the        contract with the track id   would
you put the contract in pops with the associated track id 
the transportation contract          for the liquids replacement
gas is not pops  i looked in path manager and there is no deal for it
either  in december  the deal for this gas was   could you extend the
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one  i need to set up
an accounting arrangement so i will need for you to verify the deal number
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on  when i set
up the accounting arrangement i will let you know what the track id is so you
can put the contract at meter  
let me know when all of this is done so that i can reallocate the meter 
thanks
