fyi 
it apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from    
      were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase 
therefore  vance explained to me that the volume of    dth for the period
should have been allocated to the strangers agreement  just as it was  any
deliveries were unauthorized  udog  and the gas then belongs to hpl  please
give vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue 
thank you all for your patience and assistance  i appreciate it
