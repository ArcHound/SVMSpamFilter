meter  is incorrectly scheduled to the hpl liquids contract
       in march   also last month when you were out  robert
removed the volume from the liquids contract at this meter and temporarily
put it on a strangers gas contract  if you could fix both months today and
let me know when it is corrected i would appreciate it 
thanks

anita luong  in january   and going forward  please make sure that
meters  and  are not scheduled on the hpl liquids contract
        the contract is currently out of balance by the total
volume at these two meters so if you could fix this by early tomorrow morning
