just a quick note to follow up on ua  issues 
for desk to desk deals  we are keeping the entry on co  since there is not
a co  contract with co  and attaching an ect transport contract to the
backscreen 
on park and ride deals  i am under the impression that the park and ride deal
would be booked to an  contract and cleared either intra month or in a
subsequent month 
if this is true  was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous co
 entry  i am not sure whether an ect transport should be attached  i hope
you have some insight on this issue 
let me know
