tenaska iv has been operating without a  gas agency agreement  since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august   we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september  to firm up commercial terms  which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk   should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking  that is  is there any risk we face  bank  wise or
otherwise  during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken
through the bank consent process
