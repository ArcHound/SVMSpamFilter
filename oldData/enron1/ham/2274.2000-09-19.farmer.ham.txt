are expected to in the future  you will need access to microsoft access

access  please go to the enron  itcentral  com website and complete an it
application request for microsoft access as soon as possible

on wednesday  september    a new hours survey will be distributed to
you and will be due for completion on wednesday  october    
we have developed what we think to be an easier and more efficient method of
handling the hours survey using microsoft access  the hours survey is menu
driven and you are not expected to need specific microsoft access training 
we will provide help lines and as needed direct training with the roll out of
the new hours survey  if you have any questions please contact anyone in the
