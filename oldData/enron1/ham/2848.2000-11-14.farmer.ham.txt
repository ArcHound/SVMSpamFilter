subject  beaumont methanol  meter   october 
ladies and gents 
on sat oct   hpl meter   had a malfunction  and started flowing at a
very high rate  way over the nominated rate of     d  gas control will
confirm this  
since sat  sun  mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective  i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed  by cutting
back to a lower flow rate 
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october  
  saturday through monday  the three day total for the meter is   
mmbtu  beaumont methanol nominated    mmbtu  i  e      d for 
days   we should allocate a total of    mmbtu to beaumont methanol for
the three days  and the    mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine 
under sitara   priced at gas daily hsc midpoint 
please call with questions 
thanks
