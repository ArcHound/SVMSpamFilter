Subject re  ces  devon
rita 
since this is the case  i think we need to change the way we are booking this
deal  currently  the ces  devon purchase is on   which is a dummy inlet
to the plant  rather  we should probably just have the ena purch at the
tailgate    with a d  d ticket that transfers ownership to hpl  if
necessary  please let me know what you think
