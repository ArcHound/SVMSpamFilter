i am working with jim pond to clean up the ua  that has been booked to cleburne since the beginning of the deal  we are starting with november   gas accounting has booked    mmbtu as ua  for november  which is related to deal  on the texas desk  it looks like we took some of the gas we purchased from williams  deal   on the cleburne desk and moved it to ena  s transport contract with deal   the print screen below shows the deal from zone transport to ena  texas  i think we need a deal from cleburne to zone transport to complete to deal path and clean up the ua   can you review the deals for november and let me know what you think  jim says there is ua  every month of this deal and this may be the reason  i will have to check each month 
thanks
