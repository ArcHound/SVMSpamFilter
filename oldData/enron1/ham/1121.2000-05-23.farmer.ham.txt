eric bass  texas desk trader  requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline  this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually 
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start  end dates rather than one start  end date  currently 
enrononline can
only send one start  end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara  subsequently
cleared out of the monitor 
since these transactions could flow next day  it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible  please read the full
description below   this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends  the  wkd  is short for week days  
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do  for the future  we are looking into
the cost  benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products 
if you have any questions  please call me at   
thank you

we are rolling out the use of the  x  nat gas product commencing tomorrow 
may  th 
the product is a month  long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk  it will be identified as follows 
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno  usd  mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd  which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday  tuesday  wednesday 
thursday or friday 
these products will not bridge into sitara  risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly  presumably 
strips of monday  friday trades and the corresponding month  starting days
and  or month  ending days  
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability  in the
interim  we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase
