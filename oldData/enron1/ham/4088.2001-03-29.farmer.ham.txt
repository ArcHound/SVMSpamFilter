we need to forward the money from the feb  brazos sale to tenaska iv  i am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand fee on deal  in the amount of          there is already a demand fee for feb  for        so i think we just need to change that to the new amount  let me know if you want to handle this differently
