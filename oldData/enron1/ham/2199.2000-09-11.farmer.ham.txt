i believe the best way to enter the fee into sitara would be as a demand fee
in your example   
if we do the fee this way  we will not double up the volumes 
i have attached my spreadsheet for support 
the most current worksheet is tab   marked final
column g is the over  delivery quantity total is    mmbtus
column s is the daily dollar amount for the over  delivery quantity due hplc
     
column t is the daily dollar amount for the over  delivery quantity due the
customer

there are  ways that i can enter this fee into sitara 
  i can put the dollar amount in on day  as a demand or facility fee 
  i need you to give me volume  s  and a price to input into the deal  i
can  t just input a dollar amount in sitara 
let me know how you want to handle it
