Subject re  meter   roos common point  trade zone 
vance 
the issue is that the  meter has been terminated in the system  per
cheryl jones  effective     therefore  any purchases at that point  for
   forward  are ua  and are probably having a negative impact on your
accrual  i think perhaps this deal should be backed up to a wellhead level 
there have not been any measured volumes at  since its termination  so  i
don  t know where exactly the term calpine deal is  physically  your
assistance in clearing this up is greatly appreciated
