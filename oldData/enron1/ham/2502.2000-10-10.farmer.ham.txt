bob hall  daren farmer and i met on thursday regarding the fee   i have a very
rough draft done and my plan is to revise and edit today and tomorrow 
however  i spoke with dan lyons yesterday regarding some issues with the
supply contracts that concerned me and he agrees that we need to look into
them further  in addition  bob hall  daren and i thought we might could use a
brief tutorial on the structure of the transaction generally  the parties
involved and their correct legal names and their relationship to enron  dan
lyons has volunteered to give us that tutorial but will not be available
until early next week when he and i will meet to discuss the supply contract
issues as well  call me if you have any questions
