Subject re  meter   roos common point  trade zone 
mary 
hplc currently has a gas purchase agreement  global    in place with
calpine that extends through       sitara deal no   correctly has
this contract attached to it  effective      the contract was amended
releasing gouger wells no      these wells were apparently the only
producing wells behind this point  evidence being no measured volumes in
mips  there are however other non producing wells behind this point  is
your sept
however  they were not added behind meter   therefore  i do not agree
that the deal    should be edited to change the meter 
hopefully this information is useful

cheryl is going to call the field and find out if this meter should still be
included on the termination list and also see if the field people see any gas
flow on the meter
