meter  is done  redraft your invoice for both months and let me know if
this meter is still an issue 
meter   i never heard back from aimee on which transport contract to
attach the deal  to so for the months in question the gas is still
allocated to the strangers gas contract  aimee is out on vacation until
mid  june so i put in a call to daren farmer to find out which transport
contract i should attach the deal  to 
when i find out which transport contract to use i will set up the accounting
arrangements and then get robert lloyd to put the contract in pops and
reallocate

please put the ena  contract at this meter for april and may of  with
the track id  and reallocate the meter for both months  after this is
done please let stephanie and i know so that she can redraft her invoice the
next day after pops bridges to mops  also with respect to the second issue
where daren is asking for the price  stephanie may be able to help you with
this because she has a copy of duke  s invoice 
stephanie 
the crow o  conner meter is essentially fixed  when aimee reallocates you
will have to wait until the next day to redraft your invoice  when aimee
gets back with us please redraft the invoice the next day and let me know if
this issue is resolved
