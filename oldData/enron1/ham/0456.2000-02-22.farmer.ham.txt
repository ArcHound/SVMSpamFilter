Subject cilco pathing  withdrawl and hplc transport pathing
hey guys 
just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue  while i agree that
howard  robert and george needed to work on this together  i do not think
that howard should have been the driving force behind this  once we left the
meeting  they all convened on the  th floor and worked from howard  s desk 
with howard sitting down doing much of the work  i also think that the below
e  mail should not have come from howard  but should have originated out of
the logistics group  i understand that howard has prior scheduling
experience  but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially
took on that role in getting this set up correctly  he too had to sit down
and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly
    in my opinion this is a kudoo for howard for stepping up  but i am
concerned at the role that he played  team effort is important and it  s what
we all want between our groups  but i want to ensure that everyone does their
fair share and expectations are appropriately placed  let me know what you
both think  thanks
