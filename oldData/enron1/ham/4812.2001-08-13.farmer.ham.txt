the pops meters     and  need to stay non allocatable and need to be allocated on unit gas pipeline  you will need daren or michael at enron to do the following
add meters    and  on unit pipeline to sitara deals 


then you can run the pops  report for these meters or use your allocation to properly allocate to the meters on unit pipeline 
once this is done  let me know and i will zero out the pops meters
