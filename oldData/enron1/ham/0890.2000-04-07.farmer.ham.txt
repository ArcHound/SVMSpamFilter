subject  re  equistar deal tickets
i need to have these tickets set up so the excess volumes will be priced
correctly in unify  currently unify is adding all excess volume for each day
and pricing the first    at a certain price and anything over    at a
different price  for example meter  may have  on the first  meter
 may have   and meter  may have   unify currently prices the
first    at a certain price  and  at a different price  this is
incorrect because none of the meters exceeded     each meter should be
priced at the first tier level  robert needs to set up one additional sale
ticket and one additional buyback ticket  but he will not schedule gas to
these tickets  anita luong will move the volumes to the correct ticket when
she allocates the volumes each month  equistar receives manual invoices each
month because they need to see the sale and the buyback on the same invoice 
and they also need to have each meter invoiced separately  i need to have
these tickets set up to clean up my unify draft invoices 
thanks
