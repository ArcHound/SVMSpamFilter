i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 
on    and     this sale was a brokered deal 
date purchase volume sale
       phillips gas mkt         mmbtu panenergy marketing
       mmbtu
       superior natural gas        mmbtu panenergy marketing
       mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter   if this gas was
transported away from meter   it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing  or whomever they sold the gas to at that point  and
hpl  hope this information helps

additional info i see in path manager                  
seems like this is a brokered deal  ect is buying    mmbtu from philips
gas and    mmbtu from superior gas and sell the total    mmbtu to
panenergy 
my question is then who is paying for the tranport of this gas  ect or
panenergy  we need to schedule for the delivery of this gas at meter  
please let me know
thanks
