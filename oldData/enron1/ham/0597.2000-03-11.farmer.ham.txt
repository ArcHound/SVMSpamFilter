i  ve taken care of     as far as getting it out of my allocation
exception screen   i  m going to place    on strangers gas until you
hear back from daren or julie 
should daren or julie get back w  you  while i  m on vacation  please get back
w  anita luong and provide her with the k  given to you  by daren or julie 
as well as the dates of         even though      is reflected in my
allocation exception screen  so that she can provide you with an accounting
arrangement to place february  s volumes on  this meter 
it looks as though this meter is flowing starting       i guess that the
trader will eventually place a deal in sitara for this meter 
thanks
