Subject duke energy field deal    
daren 
i am taking over the duke account from katherine and am having trouble with
   production  it looks like we have some spot deals included in the
exchange deal   i think days     which are priced at gd     
need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot  let me know if you
agree  also  can you confirm for me that days    and    are suppose to be
exchange  the sale volume for those two days was zero  so there was no
exchange  we have not received any statements from duke yet  so there is
nothing to verify our volumes 
you may also want to look at sept   for deal   it looks like spot
deals are being included in the exchange deal  those will need to be moved
to a new ticket if they are spot 
thanks
