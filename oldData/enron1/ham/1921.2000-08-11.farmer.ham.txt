fyi
this is a reduction in total capacity from    to    at station  
hpl has typically been running about    to    mmbtu through station
 in august  we can pull more gas off of the a  s line at swan lake to keep
our throughput around the    
my original conversation with epfs was that the capacity would be limited to
around    mmbtu total during the maintenance  station  will be down
through the weekend and we will get a better picture of how much we can move
without  running  i will visit with epfs on monday and see if we can get
the volume bumped up  to     and adjust on tuesday as necessary 
if you have any questions please call
