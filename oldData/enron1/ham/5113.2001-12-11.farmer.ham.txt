subject  consensual terminations
as you are aware  legal is coordinating with the trading  origination groups in handling consensual termination transactions of our in  the  money positions with counterparties that are willing to do so  could you please spread the word that these transactions should not be done by entering into offsetting trades  but rather by entering into a termination agreement with our counterparty and the counterparty paying to enron the agreed upon value  thanks
