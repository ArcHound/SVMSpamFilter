subject  fwd  gop action plan  what you can do 
 i got this from paul sperry at worldnetdaily


 
  i don  t know who joe morris is  but this sounds like a plan   note that
  this has been circulating since last thursday  
                                         
  united republican fund of illinois
  chicago
 
  november   
 
  from  joseph a  morris  president
  to  urf leaders and friends
 
  herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take
  in the event that the florida recount confirms the election of george
  bush  but al gore fails to concede 
 
  we all know what is going on in florida  and that the election hinges on
  the outcome  i am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will
  have to do if what i think is going to happen actually does 
 
  the recount  which will be finished by  p  m  thursday  will likely show
  bush to be the winner once again  with only a few thousand overseas
  ballots to be counted  those ballots will be overwhelmingly for bush  a
  minimum of   and probably closer to    if the count goes our way
  tomorrow  we have won this
  election 
 
  this is when something critical happens  either gore bows out gracefully
  or he doesn  t  and i can almost guarantee he won  t  these are people
  wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming  they will
  use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election   in  
  when richard nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election
  results he didn  t for the sake of the country  expect no such noble
  behavior this time  
 
  what will they try  one bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the
  florida results on a flimsy premise  they are already floating this as a
  trial balloon in the form of the allegedly  confusing  ballots in palm
  beach county  i have seen the ballots  they are not confusing in the
  least  indeed  they are identical in form to the punch  card ballots used
  in chicago
  and cook county  illinois  in this very election  what is more  it is
  just as likely that palm beach county voters who wanted to vote for bush
  inadvertently voted for nader  all parties approved the form of ballot
  before the election  the form  of  ballot issue is a mere pretext for an
  effort a judicial invalidation of the florida election 
 
  while i hope this scenario doesn  t come to pass  i fear that it will 
  and it will only have disastrous results for the country  the election
  fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court  if
  this comes to pass the vision of our founders and the blood of patriots
  will have been betrayed 
 
  personally  i am not going to stand for this  and i hope you won  t
  either  the good news is that we are not without voice 
 
  here is what must be done  if the vote count affirms bush  s election  we
  allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the gore camp  if they
  have not graciously conceded after a few hours  we must bombard the news
  media and our public officials at every level with phone calls of
  outrage that demand gore  s concession  i mean literally millions of
  phone calls  we must
  jam their phone banks with calls  there are millions of us so it
  shouldn  t be too difficult   while you  re at it  send e  mails to your
  local newspapers as well  
 
  if it becomes widely reported  and it will  that there is a
  groundswell demanding that gore back down and not embarrass the country 
  it will be very difficult for gore to withstand the pressure  he will
  have to relent 
 
  here are some places to start 
 
  the white house  telephone       fax        e  mail
  president  whitehouse  gov
 
  the vice president  s office  telephone       
  fax        e  mail vice  president  whitehouse  gov
 
  vice president  s senate office  telephone       
 
  senator tom daschle  senate democratic leader        
  also       
 
  representative dick gephardt  house democratic leader  
        also        
 
  also  be sure to call your congressmen and both your senators  all these
  numbers are easily located on voter  com  you can also contact them
  through the u  s  capitol switchboard 
 
  u  s  capitol switchboard  all senators and representatives     
    
 
  another office to call is that of chicago  s mayor richard m  daley  the
  brother of gore  s campaign manager  bill daley  
  telephone        fax       
 
  if you  ve never made a call like this  there  s no reason to be shy  they
  get opinion calls all the time and are set up to take them  in fact they
  like calls  it helps them tell which way the wind is blowing
