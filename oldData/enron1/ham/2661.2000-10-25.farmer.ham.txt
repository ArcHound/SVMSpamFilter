christy  i think there is a good chance that the information shown below
went to you  or your office 
i would like to get involved in finalizing plans for revenue distribution
for the n  padre production  i am certain you are way ahead of me on this
matter  spinnaker expects a division order title opining within a few
weeks  i also expect the attorney to make some title requirements which
will delay a final opinion  in talking with ranger and the houston
exploration company  they are prepared to receive their gross  shown below 
and be responsible to their respective orri owners 
how do you recommend we proceed  will hpl pay taxes on behalf of the
parties 
when you get a minute  please call me at      
thanks
