there seems to be a problem with mips while trying to actualize
the january  data  y  k related   in order to actualize jan
pops has to manually load the actual files into pops  the
side effect of this is that some of the feb data may be loaded
with numbers that are old  this will be rectified as we complete
loading the jan actuals and then load the most recent mips
measured prelim numbers for feb 
pops is currently processing the mips files in the order they
were received  we should be done with this today  please inform
us of any abnormalities that you see tommorrow 
thanks
romeo
