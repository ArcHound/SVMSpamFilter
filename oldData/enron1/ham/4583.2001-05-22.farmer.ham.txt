please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from may  and may   there are two tabs  one tab contains the days may      and the other tab contains the days may       each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question  the days most directly comparable are may     thursday  and may     thursday   although the two days preceding may    were slightly warmer than the two days preceding may     the peak on          mw  is     higher than the peak on          mw  with similarly warm days before      as there were before       the peak would obviously have been even higher  this would put the year  over  year growth in excess of    i believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year  over  year from an earlier analysis  somewhere in the range of     to
