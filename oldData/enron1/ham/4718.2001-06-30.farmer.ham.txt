tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas  from investing
for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes

but to help you take advantage of all possible provisions  we should start
planning soon  some of the ways you may benefit include 
lower income tax rates  the gradual reduction of tax rates has already
begun  in fact  the new withholding schedule went into effect on july

opportunity to invest more toward your various goals

their generous contribution limits
