subject  teco  s indian spring plant
a meeting was held on november    at  pm in eb  to resolve exxon  s
residue volume issue at teco  s indian spring plant  exxon  s issue is that
the residue volumes that hpl is recording for exxon  s account for
transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to
pge 
items that were identified so that exxon  s issue could be resolved 
  hpl is responsible for any ua  loss  gain and fuel consumed on pge  s line
attributable to exxon  s big sandy production 
  if exxon  s production exceeds  mcf  d  hpl must on a monthly basis
elect to process or not process the exxon big sandy gas  if hpl elects
to process  then teco buys the products from hpl 
  if exxon  s production flows between  mcf  d and  mcf  d  then teco
can process and makeup the shrinkage to hpl with their own gas volumes 
  if exxon  s production is less than  mcf  d  then hpl must terminate
the processing agreement  if hpl does not terminate and volume continue
to flow at less that  mcf  d than hpl loses the shrinkage and must
pay to teco an additional   per month 
solution 
  hpl will schedule and record the gain  loss volumes at hpl meter  
that is attributable to ua  and fuel on the pge line 
  hpl will schedule and record the sale volumes of pvr to teco at hpl
meter   
  the scheduling of the volumes for items  and  will allow for offset
volumes to be record as adjustments to exxon  s transport volumes 
  the hpl logistics dept   mary poorman  will inform assets group  jack
simunek  when and if the volumes nominated for exxon fall below  mcf  d 
if any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to  please
let me know at x   
thanks  clem
