subject  re  meter   acock production      
i have spoken with clem  this meter is now  non  allocatable   not unlike
meter  on big cowboy  this meter needs to be set up as a receipt meter
attached to the gulf energy      agreement  this gas began flowing on
      so deal ticket   which begins      will need to be backed up
to july to account for the purchase of this production 
bob  please email me when the deal ticket is complete so that i can have
fred set up accounting arrangements on gulf energy 
fred  can you please determine whether or not we have paid ccgm for this gas 
once again  thank you all for your assistance
