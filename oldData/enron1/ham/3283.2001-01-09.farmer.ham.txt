marketing  llc  prior to september   the gas was purchased under
contract    and deal   that expired on       effective
      the gas was again purchased from duke under contract   
deal    but this deal expires on      
currently  logistic has september and october  volumes recorded to hpl
strangers gas contract  in order to correct this  hpl logistics needs either
   deals   or   extended to cover september and october  
   a new deal to cover september and october   or    logistics needs

in addition  since deal   expires on      and gas is still
flowing  logistics needs either    deal   extended  or    a new deal
to cover december  and any other future months that this production is
flowing into hpl  s pipeline
