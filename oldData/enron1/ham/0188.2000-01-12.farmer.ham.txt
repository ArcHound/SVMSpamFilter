Subject re  hl  p for   
it is the pipelines decision on how to allocate between the shippers 
however  if the pipeline allocates the shortage to ena then we need to follow
the contract language and bill accordingly  just remember that we allowed
makeup on the       th for a total volume of  k over  days so that
will apply toward the  th and part of the  th  all other volumes should be
purchased back per the language in the contract  remember they have a
tolerance of   below the nomination 
thanks
