as you may recall  this meter needs to be set up for may  just as it was for april   below is a screen print of what april  looks like  when you had previously attempted to set this meter up  i believe it wouldn  t let you because of one  or both   of the contracts being canceled or expired  i have inquired as to what can be done and have learned that you can contact global counterparties and have them temporarily set the contract  s  back up for a short period to give us time run the volumes through the system  as i am unfamiliar with this process and the global counterparty personnel  i do not have a contact for you  hopefully this is something you may have had to do in the past  since this is a call  out meter  i can enter the actual volumes in once the contracts are set up and appear for may   in case you need to enter them  the volume should be as follows 
contract        hpl injection   
contract        tx genl land withdrawal   
i have been advised that this volume needs to be entered by the end of october if at all possible  therefore  your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated  if you have any questions  please don  t hesitate to give me a call
