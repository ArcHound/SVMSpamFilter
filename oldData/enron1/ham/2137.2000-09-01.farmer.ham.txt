Subject lone star points
daren  there were several points on your list that were previously created
and the remainder have been created  with the exception explained below 
donna and i researched your list and identified the ones that were on system
 which she would create  and the ones that were off system  which i would
create  
standard pooling stations and west texas  line x  pooling stations had no
meters  so they are not set up 
the hunt fairway plant        was previously created as     i
need to know if the    needs to be added 
we need to verify hpl  texoma         it is set up as     is
this the same point   
please let donna and myself know how to proceed with the ones in red 
thanks
