this meter has not been disconnected  the measurement tech turned in a
temporary disconnect to mips  about  months ago  because the meter has not
flowed for approximately  months  this allows the measurement tech to forgo
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service  scheduled
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice 
thanks
