Subject     days  and      
the above referenced days have been placed on strangers gas due to  i guess 
the meter not being turned off in time  the day prior to each of these days
that are assessed to strangers gas  the only active k is the hpl  
can these deals be rolled to cover these couple of days 
thanks
