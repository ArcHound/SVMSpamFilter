as you are aware  we broke a shaft in the mug compressor on the methanol
unit at clear lake on saturday march  th  we originally anticipated a two
week outage for repairs  unfortunately  due to delays in the delivery of a
coupling needed to finish repairs  we have extended the downtime for
another week  we hope to be up april  nd or  rd if all goes well
