subject  re  deal   eol waha
aquila split the volume between two points  that is why the deal changed 
the total volume was still correct  i just found out today  from stacie 
that a buy on eol needs to be on the header and come from a pgev hub or title
tracking agreement  i had previously been under the impression that
whatever pipeline the customer wanted  buy or sell  was fine with us 
however  keeping the purchases on hub agmts  will save enron
    transaction and push all imbalances and fees to the supplier
