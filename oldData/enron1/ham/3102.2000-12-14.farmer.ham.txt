the demand fee is probably the best solution  we can use it to create a
recieivable  payable with tenaska  depending on which way the calculation goes
each month  how are pma  s to be handled once the fee been calculated and the
deal put in the system 
attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the gl for cleburne as of
today  some of this info will change by the end of the month  as you can
see  there are some discrepancies between megan  s calculations and what is on
the general ledger  ua  is also on my schedule  unless the buys  sells are
volumetrically balanced  we book an entry to balance the desk  this will
change the calculation of what is due from  to tenaska  should we be
recording a ua  entry for cleburne  is it addressed in the agreement with
tenaska

in most cases  ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant  however  for october   the plant was down the
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply  resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv 
i have created deal  with a demand of          which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk   please see the attached
schedule   we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv  do we need to pay
this amount  wire from ena to tenaska iv  or is there another way to do
this  this is the case for october  and could possibly happen again in
the future 
greg  troy  jim  please let me know what you think about settling this 
megan  don  t pay the amount until we here from the greg  troy and jim 
also  make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we
reimburse tenaska iv

we have actuals  the larger of the two volumes is       which is
    day  so the demand rate in deal  is fine  i am having a
problem  though  with the way it is coming to settlements  it is showing up
with a jan  delivery date  i think the demand fee needs to be on   
only  right now  it is on a line with a date of      to       i
think this is confusing the system some how  also  we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv  it should be for a demand fee of        
booked to the cleburne desk  we actually owe          but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables  james
is calling me every day asking for an update  do you know when we will be
able to get this in the system  i have attached my spreadsheet so you can
see the numbers
