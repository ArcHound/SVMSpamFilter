Subject re  cilco storage
yes  they are taken care of  but in the future we need to devise some sort of
communication from lisa kinsey so if there
is a change with cilco  it is communicated to either you or me or aimee or
kenny or someone and it is reflected on our
withdrawal report

the cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to cilco  please
review the attached the spreadsheets from lisa kinsey  the central desk
scheduler responsible for the cilco account  the biggest variance is in
january   cilco withdrew    mmbtu  s more than we booked  bammel 
please let me know the best way to correct the problem  i suspect the
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance  also  the nomination for
the current month is    mmbtu instead of    mmbtu per day     is
the volume delivered to cilco after transport fuel
