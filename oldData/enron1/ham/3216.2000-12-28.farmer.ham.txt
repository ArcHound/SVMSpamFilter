Subject mobil beaumont refinery
just wanted to thank everybody who works with mobil beaumont refinery 
our former three year deal with them expired september   last week  we
 finally  executed a new contract that keeps hpl as their largest natural gas
supplier through september     also  when their volumes go up in early
  they will once again be hpl  s single largest industrial customer 
everybody  s hard work in keeping this customer happy has paid off  although
they can be very demanding to work with  particularly now that they are part
of exxon   they know that hpl provides them the best overall service 
please pass on thanks to anyone i  ve left off the list who has worked with
