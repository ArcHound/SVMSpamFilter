Subject re  big cowboy  gepl actuals for february
please see the attached xcel file  i think that i have found the missing volumes on big cowboy  there are two wells connected to system   which flows into the big cowboy system and interconnects with hgpl at meter   they are meters   currently in trade zone   and   currently in trade zone    i think that these should probably both be reassigned to trade zone   this should resolve our volumetric issue

please let me know if my assumption is in error  i have a schematic that shows these meters going to hgpl off of gepl big cowboy  however  if this is not correct then i will need to try to find the gas in another manner 
thank you for your time  please let me know if you have any questions  comments  suggestions
