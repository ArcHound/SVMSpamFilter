Subject gulf plains into tennessee for november
i received a call from the plant  apparently  they shorted us  dth on the
 rd of november  however  someone opened the valve on the  th and they
flowed  dth into the pipe without a nomination  the plant is asking if we
will phone tennessee and accept allocation of this volume  i realize that it
is really not alot of net difference volumetrically  but  the market has been
volatile and prices have risen significantly since the nov   rd  i also
don  t know what the market situation is like on tgpl  would we be creating an
imbalance on a contract  is there a market to allocate to  are there any
potential penalties  i would like to resolve this today  if at all possible 
please advise
