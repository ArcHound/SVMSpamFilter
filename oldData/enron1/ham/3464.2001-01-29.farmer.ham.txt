back in october we had the gas received by hpl at the above meter moved to
strangers gas pending a call from coastal to renegotiate a contract for sept
 gas  since volumes can no longer be allocated to stranger   s gas it has
been placed on an mjg deal which was the only valid deal available for sept
 
i assume coastal has not contacted brian as of yet  is it possible to have a
deal created for coastal with a price of zero  i know that we definitely do
not want to pay mjg for this gas  but as long as the volume is sitting on
their deal there is a possibility that someone may inadvertently send the
payment out  let me know what you think 
thanks

having discussed the matter with brian riley  hpl has no intention of
contacting coastal to negotiate any type of deal affecting the gas received
in september at at meter   it was brian  s opinion that the gas should be
considered strangers gas since hpl has no contract or price  it is
suggested that nick moshou contact his counterpart at coastal  relaying this
information and suggesting coastal  s trader contract brian riley

i understand that they terminated their agreement  however  i don  t feel
that we can confiscate their production  we need to either pay them for the
gas  or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter 
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month  i
would guess that they want to be paid  we won  t know that until we call
them  i don  t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut  in 
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist
