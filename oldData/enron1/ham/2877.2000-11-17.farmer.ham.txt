after speaking with gary lamphier  big thicket  s allocation for
pecos   roberson  s portion will be done differently  historically  their
portion of the allocation was reduced for shrinkage  effective with october
  s allocation  shrink will no longer be deducted  the full amount of
pecos  roberson  s gas received at meter  and delivered out at meter 
 vastar  will be kept whole  i spoke with your contact harold mcgee at big
thicket and he spoke with pecos  roberson regarding this and everyone is
agreement  your allocation process will be done the same  however the
pecos  roberson number on the allocation statement will no longer have
shrinkage deducted  i have gone over the numbers for october with harold and
he has stated the    is the amount that will be allocated to
pecos  roberson   will go to jay  and  will be for enron  this portion
has always been kept whole   can you please make sure that this is done  if
there are any questions  please let me know  thanks
