could you please remove scada  mips from the following hpl meters  these
meters are where mid  texas interconnects with
pg  e  s system  and there should not be any measurement taking place on hpl 
these meters were set up originally when we thought
that every meter on mid  texas should automatically have a corresponding meter
on hpl  this assumption is now incorecct 









thanks
george
