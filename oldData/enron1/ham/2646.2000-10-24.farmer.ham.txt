i have run this issue by clem cernosek for further research  and expect to
have his answer this afternoon  in the meantime  it is my understanding that
this well is behind the big cowboy system  at this time  we have deal ticket
  purchase from ccgm  l  p  on hplc  hplc  this deal should probably be
on gulf energy  bigcowboy  the producer  as i understand it  is acock
production  however  i may be mis  informed  any insight which any of you can
shed on this deal would be very welcome  i would like to capture this
accurately and definitively as early on as possible  so as to prevent any
future issues 
thank you all for your patience and assistance
