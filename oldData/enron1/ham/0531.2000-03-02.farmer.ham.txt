the rates are in the system correctly in unify  so that we can invoice
correctly   but daren  s group uses a sitara deal  the transport usage
tickets  to estimate desk transport in the p  l during the month  right now
we have not entered in or corrected rates in their transport usage tickets 
our group has not taken that step  since we have been most concerned with
settling the g  l  after the month is over   by not having the right rates on
the transport usage tickets  the risk is that the p  l will be off during the
month  would we change process and let daren set up the transport usage
ticket and then have us enter the rate  if so  we would need to change the
process with his group to put us in the process so that we can enter the
correct rate  please let me know what you want to do

fyi    the economics group publishes this report every month to show how much
the marketing desk spent in transport  they can get their expense numbers
either from their estimate  from cpr  or from unify  where we put the rates
in 
one potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the
transport capacity tickets  we set up the rates for the transport usage
tickets  i am going through the transport usage tickets for february right
now  as part of the market meter study  and i see some rates i don  t tie back
to lauri  s matrix  for example  lauri  s matrix shows    from thompsonville
to hsc  but the transport usage ticket  updated by daren  s group  has    
this means the economic estimate can be off  let me know what you want to do
with this
