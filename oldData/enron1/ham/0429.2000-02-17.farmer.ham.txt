in this afternoon  s meeting with producer services  jill mentioned that the
referenced well had been reperfed  meaning they shot more holes in the well
piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well  and was now producing
approximately   day  per jill  the mdq on this well is   day  you may
want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month 
mary  could you get heidi or lisa to check the transport rate we currently
show on this  it  s being purchased for sc    and is flowing through king
ranch 
thanks
