Subject    and     k extensions 
daren 
i  m attempting to clean up my allocations  due to this being allocation close
week for volume management 
    delivery meter  overflowed into march  day  only  for  
decatherms  sitara deal    start date      and stop daate
       the  k is the only one at this meter for feb  
production  i don  t see a new sitara deal number being referenced nor do i
see the evergreen flag applied here  please apprise if you can extend the
ticket for this small amount for      or if you want it handled
differently 
    delivery meter   allocated flow for          with no k
applied  days  and  for february references the  k  sitara deal
  start date      stop date       sitara deal   has
the same start and stop date as  and neither references an evergreen
flag or a new deal number  
thanks
 jackie
