subject  re  deal 
i  m assuming that since this deal is on the new texas desk  and that no new deals have been negotiated under ces counterparties that this deal is actually a truncated deal that was split to move open production from ena  im texas  which i believe no longer exists as part of the post  hpl  aep processes  to ena  im lonestar  the deals have been split several times anderson  bridgette  campos  anthony  gonzales  sharon

subject  deal 
i was researching deal   ces  midcon texas gas services corp  and found that it was incorrectly attached to contract   in fact  the gtc firm had three deals attached   since one of the deals ended       we won  t bother correcting that one  but this deal needs to be moved  i set up contract  and attached it today  this deal still needs to be reviewed by cyndie before the cp is inactivated 
elizabeth  could you please revalidate this deal 
my team  could you please add this one to your daily deal count report 
ellen  could you please reconfirm if necessary 
thanks  all  please let me know if you have any questions
