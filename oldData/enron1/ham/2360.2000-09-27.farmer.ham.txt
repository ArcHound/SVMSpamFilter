Subject big cowboy for august
daren  tom 
beginning with august production  i noticed that big cowboy  into king ranch
appeared to be flowing approximately  m over the nomination  day  per a
conversation i had with fred boas today  i discovered that two wells with
zero noms flowed a considerable volume 
they are as follows 
rocher big cowboy        approx 
big cowboy         approx 
total flow     mm  s  more or less
i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying
to account for  in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which
came on in august  please let me know what you think  i would like to make
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and
our economics 
thank you
