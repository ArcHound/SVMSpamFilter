i was informed to bill anything on hgpl by my supervisor  but when i talk to
priscilla hamic she informed me that hgpl should be billed by offsystem and
not the texas desk  the deals in sitara that relate to hgpl all state that
it is texas desk 
please let me know who should be billing mgi supply for hgpl volume
