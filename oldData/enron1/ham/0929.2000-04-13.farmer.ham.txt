Subject aspect resources  meter          production
daren 
i  m not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me  if you
are not  could you please let me know who i need to speak to 
for meter   and   for    production forward  this deal is set
up under the wrong sitara   therefore the volumes are not pulling in sitara 
the sitara  that it is currently attached to is   which this deal
was only for    production  the new sitara number that we should be using
is
sitara    for meter    and sitara    for meter  
  i have attached an example to help see what i am talking about 
 this was for    production 
could you please let me know when the change has been made or if there is
something that i need to do 
thanks  stephanie
